        "post": " 凪I'm sure I've been here before.  Oh yeah, Nagi is my favorite spot at the NY Ramen Square in Tachikawa.  I hesitated for a second, I was really hoping for something new.  But then I realized, stop thinking and just eat!I'm glad I did.  The first thing you will notice here is the booze.There are sake bottles on the walls, and everyone had a beer in front of them.  The atmosphere is one of a typical 飲み屋, the small drinking establishments that cover Tokyo.  There's even a happy hour type thing where all the drinks are 400￥.  You can order your drink in \"set\" form.  For 800￥, you get your drink and a bowl of menma and grilled pork.  Not a bad way to relax after work (or at lunch (or on the weekend)).The menu is daunting.  I think I see something on there that says ラーメンオムレツ... ramen omelet?!?  Anyways, I asked if this was the same shop as in Tachikawa, and sure enough they are related.  But, I was assured, different taste.  I went with the メガとん, megaton, which although it sounds like some sort of transforming robot was a hearty tonkotsu made with fish in the broth.The noodles are nothing like the thin, firm ones with most tonkotsu ramens.  Curly, fairly soft things that grab this amazing soup.  On the counter is some sort of mystery spice sauce that gives a nice kick as well.The real draw here, besides excellent food, is the atmosphere.  I could easily sit here with friends for a couple hours, drinking shochu and nibbling on random bites.  Is this a ramen izakaya?  It could be.Another thing to watch for, they have a ramen, it's the 4th on the menu, that changes every day.  How awesome is that!  This may become a regular spot for me on Tuesday nights, since I teach a lesson a couple blocks away.Here's a youtube video, Nagi is 3rd one in the video:Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

Today is going to be the tonkotsu soup.  The broth is like butter, almost pure white stuff that just coats your taste buds.There are a couple kinds of pork.  The regular slice and then a huge... slab of roasted meat.  If you tap it lightly with your chopsticks, it will fall apart into your soup.Everything on the menu here is great.  They even have a few rice side dishes, one with mountain vegetables on top.  I'm never quite hungry enough to spend the extra yen for that, but maybe I'll make an exception next time.From the north exit of Tachikawa station, follow the road to the left along the tracks.  It's about 2 minutes.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

The soup was really thick.  Usually thick means it's a tonkotsu or miso soup, but this was a shoyu made from chicken and fish.If you like menma, Idaten had the best menma I've had.  Some sort of special house special, they were cut long and stringy.This shop takes a definite #3 spot at the ramen stadium here.Oh, and there was a hula show in the middle of all the shops this day.  So far, I've seen a hula dance, slot car racing, and a couple live bands here.  It's all free (but the slightly overpriced ramen pays for it I guess).  Keep that in mind, there is usually something happening at this ramen stadium on Saturdays.After eating you can stop buy and have an English lesson with me a block away.  And yeah, I use this blog in some of my lessons.New York Ramen Square Site  ",

So here we are, #8 in Japan according to the list.  It's been a few months since I tried anything new from my Top 30 list, mainly because of my mission to eat lots of Tachikawa ramen.  Well I'm done in Tachikawa (done eating at new restaraunts, never done with ramen) so it's back to the grand adventure.  I only have like 6 or 7 more to go in Tokyo, which shouldn't be much of a task.  Plenty of ramen lovers hit multiple places a day, so why is it taking me months?I think it's the weather.  The mad heat of summer and bitter cold of winter make going out a pain.  But now it's the 2 or 3 weeks of nice weather between the seasons.  Some may call it autumn.  Let's eat!It's in a little alley off from the main shopping street.  There was reggae on the stereo and spot lights shining on stainless steel.  It's a nice shop.The recommended bowl was the shoyu ramen.  The little bits are carmalized onions.  Amazing taste.  Imagine a nice French onion soup gets fed to a pig.  This pig then has sex with a chicken.  The resulting mutant beast is slaughtered and somehow made into ramen.Definitely unique.  On the weekend the master makes a special ramen from some sort of French quail.  Unfortunately, I went on a weekday, so there was no obscure ramen to be had.  I'll be  back though.More Info HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " 一蘭Ichiran is an interesting place.  You are presented with a very simple ticket ordering machine.It's pretty much only 1 choice.  Ramen.  The other buttons are for extra pork or eggs.  Get some eggs, they are great here.But actually, this shop is the most customizable ramen you can have.  Before you go in, check the seating chart outside the shop.  It lights up when a seat is available.  See an open seat, go on in.  And zip those lips.You will first notice that it is totally silent in here.  And the seats have dividers, like little tiny cubicles.  So sit down in your isolation chamber and get ready for the test.7 questions... multiple choice.  The next 15 minutes of you life depends on this moment.You can choose all aspects of your ramen.  Noodle size, noodle tenderness, soup flavor strength, spice level, garlic, with or without pork, and how oily you want it.  Go for the middle choice all the way down if you want to be safe, or mix it up.Ichiran fares from Kyushu, so expect a bowl of tonkotsu style.  A totally average bowl that is.  When you get your food, the door in front of you closes and you are in complete oneness with normality.  The beige ramen zone.Also... I was totally crammed in the little booth.  The seat doesn't move, so my knees were jammed up against the counter and my ass was hanging halfway off the back.  I was holding on to the counter with one hand, eating ramen with the other.  At any moment I could have slipped and ended up on the floor in a heap of noodles and pork broth.  Not the best way to go... but not the worst either.Check out this excellent video of Ichiran.There are Ichiran shops in many places in Tokyo.  I'd say it's one of the most popular bowls of Kyushu style you can find.  But the cramped seating means I won't go back (even though I did).  By the way, I'm 6'4\" (192cm) so this isn't really a problem for most people.They are open late, so it is an acceptable post-drunk-party bowl.  But if you want to really enjoy ramen, search out something a bit more special.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " のんきやOn the shores of Lake Okutama in the far west of Tokyo there is ramen.  I didn't think there would be many good shops out here.  Usually you find a couple soba or udon noodle makers in the mountains, but ramen isn't too common.But I was wrong.  Luckily my Touring Mapple had the 411.  Mapple is like the Japanese version of Thomas Brothers maps.  They have maps for everywhere in Japan.  The Touring Mapple series is designed for motorcycle riders.  Hot springs, budget hotels, and of course good cheap food is highlighted.  So when I saw Nonkiya Ramen a few kilometers ahead I had to stop.The ramen was a standard shoyu.  But the hadnmade noodles were really excellent.  Springy and firm.The shop overlooks the lake.  At one point, a 3 year old girl runs in to the shop screaming \"Obasan! Obasan!\"  Then she ran up to her grandma (my waitress) and gave her a freshly picked clover.  Next stop on the little girl's journey was an Anpanman cartoon.  She didn't even skip a beat at the lone foreigner in their countryside family noodle shop.On the way out, I noticed this sign.  It says there are 125 ramen shops in Okutama.  I'd be better off completely ignoring this.  To me it's a challenge.  Dozens of ramen otaku, guidebooks in hand, taunting me into more ramen searches.Okutama is the end of Tokyo.  The train stops and you can't go further.  How they are able to have a published book about ramen in this area is beyond me.But this just hammers in the point.  Ramen is a never ending thing in this country.  Your next bowl may be on the ground floor of your apartment building, or hidden in the mountains.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

A normal amount of abura, those floating particles af fat that help people live to be over 100. I'm convinced that's the secret. Recently I read some parts of a book where the author says to never drink water, because it dries you out. I'm getting off track, but yeah, normal shoyu stuff here.The problem with shoyu ramen is that the really really good ones are only slightly better than the really really cheap ones. A massive bowl of shoyu ramen can be had for as little as 190 yen, that's less than 2 bucks, in some places.  I guess my palate isn't refined enough to tell the subtle differences.Success!There it is, all the shops at Tachikawa's NY Ramen Square. I'll go ahead and say that the 2 Kyushu shops, Nagi and Samurai, are the best. With Nagi taking a slight lead because they had some unique toppings to add to the ramen.If you're ever in Tahcikawa on the weekend, hit me up, I'll be eating some noodles at lunch time.New York Ramen Square SiteView Larger Map  ",

Little rice grain sized bits of pork fat. You don't feel them, they just blend in with the soup. Toppings were standard fare. Bean sprouts, about 2 tiny pieces of cabbage, pork and an egg. Sounds like Ramen Jiro.  I made the mistake of ordering 大盛り, the large serving, which came with 400g of noodles instead of 200g.Ordering too much has been a recurring theme lately. Remember, on the ticket machines, the standard, normal size ramen is usually on the upper left.One of the waitresses had a swastika tattoo on her arm. She didn't look like a Shinto priestess or a Neo-Nazi, and it was obviously done in someones bathroom with a safety pin and magic marker.

A couple kinds of seaweed, sprouts, corn, pork, onions, and butter is what I recall off the top of my head. Butter and corn pair very well with miso ramen.  For about 3 bites.  Then it's just too rich.A few months ago, before I moved out of my old residence in Ogikubo, a 味噌一 (Misoichi) opened a couple minutes away. There are a few locations in the western part of Tokyo, check the map on their website. The Ogikubo one is about a 15 minute walk from the station. The one in Koenji looks like it's right next to the station. Go to the one in Koenji. Koenji is fun. Ogikubo isn't.It's a great shop, the standard bowl is full of vegetables, no pork. It's nice, it gives you the impression that you are eating healthy. I'm talking about the standard bowl, not the スタミナ one. The stamina bowl just hurts.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

Well, this wasn't...bad... but it wasn't anywhere near awesome. I was the only one in the crowded restaurant who ordered this, so that's saying something.A break between classes meant that I had to try out the NY Ramen Square in Tachikawa.  All the magic of what I assume New York is like, plus overpriced ramen from famous shops.  I heard that Ippudo has a shop in Manhattan that charges about $13 for a bowl, so I guess the overpriced factor is for authenticity.Yeah, I know about a month ago I said that ramen theme parks are lame.What I ate was cold ramen noodles in a cold tomato soup with a couple dozen cheery tomatoes on top. There was a little basil on it as well. It cost 950 yen. The noodles gripped the sauce really well, but they were super tough. Normally, this is a good thing, but I was wearing work clothes and had to eat really, really slow. Extra slow because the texture of the noodles made them like a slingshot of tomato sauce aimed at my light purple dress shirt.Wine would have been nice. It was on the menu, but for some reason I didn't want to drink before going back to work. This is ironic, because one of my standard conversation topics with my adult students is booze.Back to ramen.  I'll try some other places here over the next month or so, since I work in Tachikawa every Saturday now.  This ramen stadium is a happening place.\"I can has ramens now?\"If you want to go to NY Ramen Square in Tachikawa, take the JR Chuo line from Shinjuku to Tachikawa. You don't have to even go onto the street, there is a bridge from the station to the Area building. Exit on the south side and you will see Area in front of you. Go up to the 3rd floor. There is no admission charge, and ramen is around 950 yen at most shops for the special versions with all the good toppings. Enjoy, and let me know if you go on a Saturday!New York Ramen Square SiteView Larger Map  ",

I had the summer release, a spicy dipping noodle.  I missed the autumn.  And now it's the winter one.The broth has almost no flavor.  The noodles were way soft.  The cabbage didn't add much.  Is this a complaint?  Not really.  This ramen would be great as a chicken soup substitute for the sick.  About half a dozen won-tons add to this.  Actually, it tastes almost exactly like won-ton soup at Chinese restaurants in America.If you are easy to get jealous, you will see what other people are eating and suddenly that green eyed monster will rear it's head.

You see, Ippudo took the New York scene by storm, becoming a very trendy spot in one of the trendiest cities in the world.  I hear it's good stuff, loyal to the shops out here in Japan.  I'm all for ramen expansion across the globe.  I only knew instant noodle ramen when I lived in California.  To someone who doesn't understand, it's like comparing Spaghetti-Os with homemade family recipe spaghetti at a little shop in Napoli.    The menu is simple.  You can get the traditional shiro motoaji (白丸元味) Hakata style ramen, or the modern akamaru shinaji (赤丸新味) style, which adds garlic oil and a stronger soup.  There are a few other things on the menu, I hear the gyoza is good.  Also, there are \"Hakata Buns\" which use the same pork from ramen in a bun with some toppings.  They looked good too.  Future prospects.  Ippudo should be on every first timers list.  It a great intro to the creamy smooth soup that comes out of Hakata in Kyushu.  Ichiran is another choice for this style, but I don't like the solitary seating style at that one.  Ippudo is a much more social type place.  The one in Kichijoji is downstairs, open very late, and comfortable to hang out in with friends.   Official Site Here   View Larger Map       ",

I had just moved from Kure, a city in Hiroshima prefecture, and hadn't had good ramen in a really long time.  But I knew one guy who could set me straight.Jackie Chan!A few days prior he had been to this area and ate here.  Actually, this shop is in the NTV building.  So maybe it's sort of a celebrity hangout.  Don't expect to meet Jackie Chan.  If you are lucky, you could meet a Japanese celebrity, like that guy who dresses like a school girl and beats people with a kendo sword.  Or that dude who counts, and every time he says \"8\" he makes a funny face.  He's very popular (in Japan).The ramen here was created by some guy who won some TV contest.  That's all I know.  I told you, it was like a year ago, before I became a ramen maniac.The soup is a soy sauce broth with seafood used to flavor it.  I remember it being on the strong side.At the end of the meal, toss in a bowl of rice with fried pork into you soup.  Yum.Sorry, that's all I have to say.

If you are feling like even more meat, you can order rice topped with grilled meat (pork I'm assuming).  I saved about half the soup broth and dumped the rice in at the end of the meal.

Abura is the floating bits of fat that form when making the soup.  Many tonkotsu shops will strain out the fat, since... well... it's just globs of oily pork fat.  But other shops actually specialize in this stuff.  It's silk smooth and tasty, but you will feel like crap after eating too much.To add instult to injury, almost everyone who came in this shop got their ramen with メーヨ topping.  That's mayonaise people!  Why stop with half a liter of artery clogging fat chunks when you can add mayo.I had the bubuka special, which comes with 3 thick slices of their pork, which they grill on a little burner before serving.  The pork is up there with the best of the best, it's so good.  My advice here is to eat the pork, noodles, and other toppings, then maybe nurse the broth a little, but don't try and finish it.  It's hard to do, but your body will thank you.Bubuka is hella crowded at night with drunk salarymen.  Kichijoji is a bit of a transport hub into the west of Tokyo, so a lot of people come through here on their way home.Keep you eye out for the instant version in a supermarket near you.

One of the best things about this shop is that it is run by a little old lady and a little old man.  I always see them when I walk by.  It seems like the shop is only open when they feel like opening it.Inside, it was just me and another old lady eating.  Eventually, another old lady came by to chat with the owners.  It was pretty much an old lady ramen party.  Everyone involved was over 80 years old today.  Imagine spending your golden years running the neighborhood ramen shop, just chatting with friends and making the occasional bowl.So even though the ramen was pretty normal shoyu soup, the air of this place was fantastic.

Take the escalators to the top floor of this department store and you are treated to about 10 Chinese restaurants.  Half are dim sum places, others are random chinese food, but one, Chen Ping, is a ramen shop.Tangy!The taste is almost like Vietnamese Pho broth.  Salty and spicy.  The taste of cilantro went well with the shrimp and fried pork bits that were in the bowl.Nice to have something different, but the fact that I was eating in a department store kind of took away from the magic.From JR Tachikawa, take the Granduo exit.  It's on the 7th floor in Chinatown.Granduo China Town SiteView Larger Map  ",

On the side, those are 大学いも (university potatoes?).  Also served with an apple and milk.  Ramen doesn't really match with milk (stick with water), but the sweet fried potatoes do.The soup was a sort of random thing.  More like real soup than ramen broth.  There were lots of carrots and bamboo shoots.I had the 大盛 size with a couple extra plates of potatoes and an extra 2 milks.I did a small survey of the kids I ate lunch with this day (about 30 thirteen year olds) and they actually prefer miso ramen the most.  Adults are like 90% for tonkotsu, which makes sense.Ever had ramen served at your school?  ",

It's right in the heart of Shibuya, where the proverbial \"action\" is.  Everyone who visits Tokyo has to go to this area at least once.  It's like a rule or something.Plus one point for apparently being the number one ramen shop according to a Yahoo internet poll.  In the bottom it says ラーメン　オブ　ザ　イヤー = Ramen obu za iya (pronounce it slowly and phonetically)Plus one for a great lively atmosphere.  The staff of at least 6 shouts their welcomes to every customer who comes in the door, and shouts there thank yous as you leave.  Clever, this shop has a separate entrance and exit, to avoid any ramen related traffic jams as customers scurry in and out.And the ramen ain't bad either.  It's a perfect bowl, just the right saltiness, noodles, and toppings.  I can easily understand why this would be given some sort of internet award, though it seems like they could give every shop in Tokyo some sort of award, or ranking, and still have left over ramen ranking king story magazines to sell.Although I have to subtract points for the super cheesy \"philosophy\" poster above the kitchen.  It says something to the extent:You will be surprised your first timeYou will have a different taste your second timeOn your third time, you will understand the original tasteBut I can overlook sappy stuff like that.Dare I say that this is the #1 ramen shop for a first timer in Tokyo?  I think I can go out on that limb.  Sure, it doesn't have the unique, remarkable taste of other shops, but this is the bowl that will set you on a path, erasing every bad instant noodle moment from college, covering them with that umami you crave.Official Site Here  ",

Deep in the heart of Golden Gai, a place which must be seen, is this little ramen shop.  Golden Gai will be in your travel books, or easily pointed out by a local host.  Hunrdeds of small drinking establishments, most only holding 4 or 5 people at a time line the dark alleys.There's also a ramen shop holding about 5 cozy people.On a tuesday night at 7:30 there were a few people in there, but I was able to squeeze into a seat.The special here is the long flat noodles, which are then cut by hand into thin ones.The standard bowl also comes with a couple uncut noodles thrown in for fun.One thing about Nagi, with it's 3 locations in Tachikawa, Shibuya, and Shinjuku is that each one has a very different taste.  At the Golden Gai shop, a lot of fish goes into making the thick soup.  Also a good amount of green onions.  So expect a strong taste.The owner is a cool guy named Ikuda.  Very welcoming, he was overjoyed that I had come from the Shibuya shop and that I was somewhat of a ramen maniac.  But, unfortunately, he speaks crazy fast, so I only understood a third of what he said!Oh, and it's open late.  This says until 4am...Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

It's on the street level.Right next to Tachikawa station, in what could only be described as prime real estate gone bad, is a little ramen shop.  Literally 2 seconds from the busy station, this run down building looks like it could go any day.  It was recommended to me by a student, and I've actually been there about 4 times in the last year.  This time I remembered my camera.It's a straight forward bowl, with 2 choices of soup.  The とんこつ pork broth is decent, but not even in the running against ばんから　or 凪, which are both nearby.  The other choice is かつおだし.  Katsuodashi is a simple broth used in all sorts of Japanese cooking.  It could be said it is the chicken stock of Japan.  Made from dried fish flakes, it has a subtle salty taste.  If you'v ever eaten anything in Japan, chances are it was flavored with this broth.A little fishy, the taste lingers longer than a soy sauce broth.  Today, for some reason, it seemed to linger longer than usual, and I found myself popping mints 30 minutes later before my next student's lesson.Yep, another ramen shop in Tachikawa.  Maybe I should move to a new school for my Saturday lessons, I think I've exhausted this place.  I know there's a Ramen Jiro here too...More Info HereView Larger Map  ",

(Often, in Japan, you will see a W instead of double or 2X because the way of pronouncing W is da-ba-ru, which sounds the same as double)Anyways, on to the cheese ramen.  1st question of course would be... it it delicious?  I have good news and bad news for you there.  Good or bad first?  You want the good?  Ah, an optimist I see.  Well then, yes, it was delicious.The つけめん noodles are served with a healthy pile of Parmesan cheese on top.  That would just be a single, so on the side you get a bowl of what appeared to be Kraft cheddar cheese sauce.  Now it's the W.  Pour the cheese onto the noodles, and actually this would be suitable for a meal any day.  You've pretty much created a ramen noodle version of Mac and Cheese (or Kraft Dinner for my Canadian friends).Being つけめん though, you are given a bowl of strong soup.  Much too strong to drink straight, but perfect for dipping the noodles into.  This shop specializes in a miso taste, with lots of vegetables and fish used to make the broth.  Plenty of bits and pieces of pork, carrots, fishcakes, and menma complete the dish.Yes, it was as delicious as it sounds.Now the bad news.  I was a little drunk when I ate here.  Not the worst news, but ramen, covered in 2 kinds of cheese is definitely drunk people food.  So my view may be different if I eat there sober.  Which I probably will never do.  You see, the Baird Nakameguro Taproom is right next to the station.  If you like micro brew beer (地ビール, jibiru) then Baird is the best in Japan.  Hands down.Oh, and on the topic of W, is it ironic that I got drunk off a micro brew called オバマIPA?  That's Obama IPA.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

It costs about a buck for a packet, and, although it doesn't come with any toppings, it is amazing.  Like liquid gold going down your throat.  Except that might hurt.  The ramen doesn't hurt.So this gift box looked like it might come with all the toppings for a proper Hakata style ramen.  Word.Well, it didn't.  It only came with the noodles, soup mix, and red pickled ginger.  They couldn't at least have included some sesame seeds?  And freeze dried green onion technology has come a long way people.But how did it taste?Not too good.Managed to overcook the noodles I think, and then the noodles managed to soak up 90% of the soup.  So it was big, soggy noodles.  The soup tasted like... salt.  No magic pork flavor.Lesson learned, don't buy a ramen gift from the airport.  Some ramen shops in Japan have them, and you can get a few at the ramen museum in Yokohama, if you go there.  ",

The problem with Los Angeles is that you need:A car, cause public transport is whackA ton of free time, cause LA traffic is whackLucky for me, Keizo has a ranking of 2008 LA ramen over at his site.  I picked the closest one to where I was staying, Ramenya.Yep, it had a 20 minute wait out front.  So far so good.  From outside, everything looked pretty honest.  Sat at the counter and asked for a recommendation... in Japanese.  This is simple Japanese, おすすめ ？Osusumeh should get me the house specialty.  Even if it's just a standard bowl, I always do it.  Her reply was, \"Just look at the pictures on the menu.\"Hunh?To be honest, the おすすめ fails in Japan about 10% of the time too.  But really, I know your place is popular and you can afford to be stand offish, but at least make something up.I chose a bowl of negi ramen.The pork was more of a shredded pork than traditional slices.  It was also a little spicy, which was great.  All in all a good bowl, worth a trip or 2 if you live in the area.  I like shoyu ramen, but if I found a good tonkotsu place I'd most likely never go to Ramenya again.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " 梅もと(kind of hard to find.  Walk south from Ikebukuro station for about 10 minutes and make a left on a little alley way.  雑司ヶ谷3-7-10 is the address.)A friend told me about some ramen which uses salt from her home town on a little island south of Tokyo.  Recommendations are always taken into consideration.  So I strolled down the back alleys of Ikebukuro, thinking of a nice salt ramen.  Something light and refreshing.  I was met with:Let me explain.  Ramen, especially tsukemen, usually has a size element to it.  How many 玉, tama, do you want?  On average, you get about 200 grams of noodles when you eat in Japan.  The tama is how many servings. １玉、２玉、even ３玉 is fairly standard.  But we usually talk in terms of 盛り, mori, size.  Generally, you have your normal serving, and your omori, which means big size.  This is standard at ramen shops, beef bowl shops, curry shops, basically anyplace that caters to the salaryman.  Cause salarymen love to eat big portions.This is not omori.  We are now well into the realm of competitive eating.  But let's examine the size options at Umemoto a little closer.The first 3 are smal, medium, and large.Next, at ３玉 is 地球盛... earth size.４玉 follows with 銀河盛... galaxy size.５玉 is 宇宙盛... universe size.Let's skip 6 and go to ７玉, Big Bang size.１０玉 is Black Hole size.And at an insane ２０玉 is 流星盛, meteor size.Also if you don't finish eating what you order, you are assesed a penalty of 700 yen for sizes up to Black Hole, and 2000 yen if you can't finish the Meteor size noodles.Always one to walk along the razor's edge, I went with the 地球盛, earth size.  If any of the 450 grams of noodles were to be uneaten, there would be a price to pay!  That price would be cash money.  700 yen.The miso broth was creamy and had a lot of sesame on top.  Potent, nothing close to a simple salt broth I was expecting on my walk here.The noodles were thin and heavy.  Really heavy.  They began to sit like a half kilo of cement in my stomach.  But that was my fault for ordering more then the standard size.  Regardless, I was able to put away the triple serving without a hitch.One thing I love and hate about Japan is their view towards food.  This shop is plastered with famous people's photos.  I use famous loosely here, because these people are only really famous because they go to restaurants and eat things out of the ordinary, like \"black hole\" tsukemen.  By doing this enough, they become famous on TV.  Sort of.Hundreds of magazine articles about the sheer size of noodles one can buy are plastered on the wall.  That's the claim to fame, the fact that you can buy extra noodles here.But it takes on a sort of charm, this rather silly approach to eating.One thing that struck me was the standoffish nature of the staff.  I was the only person in the shop for a time, and I tried striking up a conversation.  My questions were met with one word answers and no eye contact.  When another customer came in, I was ignored all together.  I think if your restaurant specializes in what boils down to, let's face it, a novelty meal, you should be jovial about it.  Or maybe they are just dead serious, and had I left a noodle or two in my bowl the door would be blocked and police summoned until I forked out the required penalty fee.More Info HereView Larger Map  ",

But this was the day of rest for burgers, apparently, and I needed something quickly before the next bullet train back to Tokyo.  Buson was recommended.A few styles on the menu.  First is a standard pork bone style.  Next is a standard salt.  3rd was しじみ which is a type of tiny clam.  It's often put into miso soup, but how would it taste in a ramen soup?  You have questions? I have answers.The answer is \"I don't know, I didn't try it.\"Their special was あご - ago - flying fish.  I couldn't pass up something like this.  A heavy pork soup flavored with flying fish.  I've eaten plenty of とびこ, which is flying fish eggs, but rarely have I had any other flying fish related cuisine.It really worked.  Can't say I could tell you the difference between a soup flavored with flying fish and... any other fish, but it worked.  Not too thick, the subtle fish aroma alongside the rich とんこつ soup was perfect for the cold night in the mountains.  I think an interesting touch would be a small dollop of bright orange flying fish eggs on the top.  Too artistic?The salt ramen wasn't bad either, made with high quality salt.  Also, it was served with a lemon wedge.  I've never seen that before.Some local spices added a nice touch.So Nagano was cast in a bad light by the overly salty meal the day before, and redeemed by this smaller shop.If you ever find your way to Nagano, enjoy.More Info HereView Larger Map  ",

Actually, you can order it 薄める - usumeru - thin.  I recommend this path.  The regular soup was just too salty for us.  Many bowls remained half eaten.Toppings are a plethora of green things.

I've heard about some people hating Hakata style ramen because of the stinky smell, but I had never really experienced this.  That is... until Botan.\"Like a good swiss cheese,\" is how a friend described it.  Yes, thats perfect.  It was like the swiss cheese I bought from a cheese vendor on the border of France and Switzerland in the city of Chamonix back in 2002.  This cheese had been aged in a cave and was covered with a layer of wax and dirt.  Cut into it and there you go.  Stinky.  The good kind.  That's what you smell when you walk in the door.There you have it, the wonderful creation that is Hakata ramen.  I can't say I've had bad Hakata ramen yet.  I think Ichiran tastes a little more refined, but the whole eating in silence in a one person cubicle thing isn't worth it.  Maybe Ippudo could take top marks, but I'd say that is more Hakata Nouveau style.  A drizzle of garlic spice oil isn't an option at most places.One bonus of this shop is that you get a coupon for a free serving of noodles the next time you come in.

I'm still not totally sure what this stamp rally is all about.  I'd like to think it will culminate in something wonderful, like a ramen exposition, or at least a ramen party of some kind.  But most likely it will just end with me in an ugly ramen t-shirt.Musashiya was some fairly normal, albeit rather thick tonkotsu ramen.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't anything special.You'd think that a thick, meaty soup like this would be great for someone who was still a little drunk from a day of hanami, sitting under the cherry blossoms drinking whiskey and plum wine.

It's down a little side alley in a rather hip part of Kichijoji.  The shop touts itself as a regular old ramen shop at lunch time, and a cool music and dining bar at night.  The staff was young and fresh, with tasteful facial piercings.  Rebel enough to bring in the kids, but conservative enough not to scare away the old folks.Here it is, a salty tonkotsu ramen.  All the elements were nice.  Thick soup, great noodles, and one of the best eggs I've had in a while.  It tasted like concentrated soy sauce.But I'm a little bitter.  I ordered the shiro ramen.  The guy next to me ordered something different and it came with a big piece of seaweed that had been branded with the store's logo.  How fun!  Also I forgot my good camera lens and had to walk to the other side of the store just to take a picture of my food with my big telephoto lens.But on the bonus side, this was another stamp on my Tamagumi Springtime Ramen Stamp Rally!  2 down, 10 to go-Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

I went into a sort of ramen slump, if you will.  I fell into routine, becoming a creature of habit.  Saturdays were usually spent eating at Bankara, and locally I tend to go to Ippudo a lot.  But it's time to change, time to experience new bowls!きら星(from Musashisakai station, take the south exit and go a little west to 武蔵野市境南町3-11-13 )Kiraboshi, which is only about 10 minutes by bicycle from my place.  How did I not go here yet?  Well, the simple answer is that this was the 4th time I've gone.  Once I got there too late.  Once they were on vacation.  Once I just missed the lunch hours.  4th times a charm.The menu and... a stamp rally?  More on that later.There was a line of 4 people outside.  About a 15 minute wait before I was seated and ready to eat.The payoff.  Thick, concentrated soup.  The master simmers pork bones for 30 hours to make his soup.  This isn't everyday ramen, it was very heavy.  Remember I said this place is only 10 minutes by bicycle for me?  Yeah, don't ride a bicycle after eating.One signature here is a little dollop of saba, mackerel fish, paste.  It's will add a nice little kick of something different when mixed in.  I gotta complain about the raw onion bits thrown in though, I'm not a fan.できた! Done!There is a stamp rally going on in my area for the next month!  The information is here.  If I get all 12, I get a Tシャツ... a T-Shirt.  I hate cheezy giveaway shirts, but I'll give it a go.

It's about a minute up on the other side of the street)  This place was recommended a while back by Keizo over at GoRamen.  Since he was in town, it was a perfect excuse to check it out.  We also met up with another English ramen blogger Nate from Waseda-Ramen.  Rolling 3 deep, we went on the attack.    Basanova does the fusion thing, with a highly recommended green curry ramen and tom yum ramen on the menu.  The green curry is Keizo's staple here.    I've had some \"Thai\" style ramen before, and it usually just tastes like reused curry broth poured over noodles.  This often doesn't work because curry or tom yum soup is meant to be eaten differently, with rice balancing out the intense heat.  Noodles don't really take the edge off of the spice as well.  But this one was very well balanced.  More of a tangy spice than a burning pain spice.  Excellent.    I asked the chef what he recommends for a first time, and had the tondatsu wadasisoba.  1st item on the menu.    Very solid bowl, worthy of an extra serving of noodles.  Luckily I didn't go for that option, because we weren't done with the ramen for the evening...      More Shop Info Here       ",

You are greeted with the usual fanfare of a good ramen shop, and also some huge black and white photos from what looks like the 50s.  Does old translate to good in the language of ramen?First off, let me say this.  The layer of oil on this shoyu ramen is scalding hot.  I wish I would have familiarized myself with rameniac's account of the place and prepared.  I didn't, and 24 hours later am still recovering from singeing off all my tastbuds.Don't let this photo fool you.  That soup spoon is more than double the size of a normal soup spoon.  This is a big, expensive bowl.  The cheapest one is a whopping 1050 yen.  I don't often post prices, because almost every bowl in Japan is 700-800 yen.  But breaking the 1000 yen barrier with no real selection of toppings... I'm against that notion.I couldn't finish this bowl.  I had burnt my tongue, and even the warm left over soup hurt.  But it wasn't a bad bowl.  Actually, it was really good.  So good that they have a thriving omiyage, gift pack, business.You can fill out a delivery slip and they will send it anywhere in Japan.  Too bad all my ramen friends live stateside!I had a real delight when I found a small piece of yuzu peel in my soup.  Their broth is complex like that.  And the noodles are curly, springy, eggy delights.  But seriously, eat them 2 at a time or you will burn yourself.  My slurping skills are pretty good I humbly admit, but I was beaten down at Taishoken.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

How can they possibly live up to something like that?!?By recreating the moon reflecting into your bowl of ramen... that's how!  The lights are turned down way low, and each seat has a tiny moveable LED lamp for you to see by.  Brilliant.How did I miss this cool place?  The interior alone is worth a visit.

The oil acts as insulation and keeps the soup piping hot.Hot soup leads to hot noodles and some serious slurping.

        "post": " 凪    It's been a while since I've been to Nagi in Shibuya.  The first time I went, I sang it's praises and it became an almost weekly trip.  I loved sitting down and ordering a だれやめ set, beer with a side of grilled chashu pork and menma.  The lights were dim, the staff friendly, and the ramen excellent.  I taught a private lesson near this shop, so it was a match made in heaven.  Teach some English, eat some ramen.  But times change.  My lesson moved to another part of town, and this shop is the opposite direction.  Today I made the trek, and was greeted by a surprise.  2 of the 3 things I loved about Nagi are gone!  First, the decore.  It used to have bottles of shochu lined up along the walls, and toy pigs scattered throughout.  It was tacky, in the way that makes a dive bar come to life.  But now it's empty.  The wall of booze had a curtain, and not a butta to be seen.  Second, the menu is new!    Nagi is now just a standard Hakata ramen place.  Take a look at the old menu for comparison.    There were over 40 different items.  The daily ramen experiment, ramen omelet, fried ramen with cheese.  It was the funnest ramen I've seen in Japan.  The menu was hand written in messy kanji that I could barely make out.  Ordering involved chatting with the staff.  It was good.  Now, it's a 1 item thing.  I don't really understand why they would change things up.  Maybe it's a new owner.  No clue.  But, the new ramen is really good here.  I can't complain at all about about the outcome.  Richer than the other Hakata style I've had so far.  I think they may be using the same recipe as the Nagi in Tachikawa, though it tastes... better.  However, I probably won't be going back here as often as I did, which is kind of sad.  Maybe I'll give it a month or so, and see how I feel then.  By the way, this review is outdated, but I've gone back to make a YouTube video. Check out!      Official Site Here   View Larger Map  ",

        "post": " アイバンラーメン  (from Rokakoen station, take the north exit and turn left at the first intersection)  A visit from fellow English language ramen blogger Keizo  warranted a visit to Ivan Ramen.  Opened back in 2007 by a foreigner from New York, this shop has been a huge buzz in the Tokyo ramen world.    In Tokyo, there's a funny, and sad, fact about restaurants and foreigners.  There still exists a fascination with foreign things, especially in the realm of food.  This leads to a lame result... any knuckle head can open a restaurant if they look the part.  For example, a good friend of mine got a job at a French restaurant a few month ago.  She just happens to be French.  Her job was to be the wine and cheese person.  So far, so good.  But, she admits to me, she knows almost nothing about wine and cheese.  She's just French, and that's enough.    Ok, so people are fascinated by foreignness.  They are going to be doubly fascinated if a foreigner opens something beyond their norm.  Enter Ivan Orkin.  And a ramen shop.  I'll admit it, I was skeptical.  The whole thing could just be some ploy.  A lot of the big money ramen industry runs on gimmicky fuel, like television spots or challenge style eating.  \"I saw Aoi Miyazaki eat a triple size bowl!  We have to go!\"    The shop's been open for some time now, and still had a 15 minute wait to get in.  During this time Ivan himself came out to talk with us.  He explained his philosophy towards cooking and ramen.  He wants something where each aspect can be fully enjoyed by itself or with the rest.  Ramen is a group effort, the right noodles, soup, and toppings.  But to make something where each aspect stands out, therin lies the chef's goal.    The menu has a lot of items.  Besides the standard shoyu and shio ramen and tsukemen, there are more \"gourmet\" fair.  So I went for a bowl of his shio ramen, and a small roasted tomato and pork rice bowl.  The rice bowl was wonderful.  If you have an appetite, definately tack one of these on to your order.  But on to the ramen...    Salt ramen is actually not so common.  The reason, I think, is that a bad salt broth is horrid, while a bad soy sauce broth or miso broth is palatable.  Ivan's creation is, as expected, delicious.  Although not the porky goodness of the tonkotsu I usually go for, this soup is complex.  The menma was awesome.  The pork great.  The half cooked egg didn't disappoint.  And the handmade noodles were perfect, nice and thin.    Keizo had the tsukemen.  I had a taste, and they were pretty good.  Ivan mentioned that he might be delving into more cold style noodles this summer.  But for the time being, I'm sold.  I'll make a couple more trips out here to try the spicy chili ramen and the roasted garlic ramen.  There's also homemade ice cream, which I totally forgot about.       View Larger Map         ",

I start a new job soon, so daytime ramen will be numbered.The master recommended the soy sauce ramen.  Which I had with some 岩のり, a type of seaweed.  It was well done, and I can understand why this place has a line on weekends.The shop seems to specialize in cold, soup-less noodles, but since it was a brisk April day, I went for something hot.

Speaking of hot, this ramen was hot.  Not the sexy kind, but the scalding oil variety of hot.I've never had a tonkotsu with half an inch of boiling oil on top.  The best way to cool it off was to load on the toppings.  Standard fare here, but this time you get your own mortar and pestle to crush the sesame seeds and garlic.  Fun!The guys next to me were trading collectible maid cosplay cards.This shop was right in the middle of the Akihabara madness.  I bought some cheap SD cards next door.  Just down the street is Super Potato, your retro gaming one-stop superstore.  There was a guy dressed as Pikachu handing out cakes on the road.  I like it here.Trouble finding the shop?  It's right under a giant adult movie store.  Enjoy!The ramen was standard.  I think the hot oil on top takes a lot of the flavor away.  Maybe that's because my taste buds were singed off though.Store Info Link  ",

It's just past the building covered in crazy chains, which incidentally is a school for the blind)After a lengthy detour down some back alleys of Takadanobaba, there was Yasube.  And there was the line of 18 people.  If you are a ramen nut, and have the time, this usually isn't a problem.  Someone once calculated that it was 4 or 5 minutes per person in line.  But this is a tsukemen shop, and things are different.As you can see from the sign above, all the sizes are 720 yen.  This is one of the selling points of tsukemen.  Most shops offer any size you want for the same price.  So it's essentially an all-you-can-eat noodle buffet!  Just don't order the big one and only eat half.  I've never seen someone order a 440 grams of wet noodles and then leave it.  I can only imagine the shame.A line of 18 people, and I sat down after only about 15 minutes.  How is that possible?  Well, tsukemen arrives cold, and cold goes down much faster than piping hot, oil covered ramen.Today I ordered the spicy tsukemen.It wasn't too spicy, but you can feel free to load a pile of diced onions into the soup, like most people were doing.I'm not down with onions in my ramen.Yasube was pretty standard.  I'm not, nor will I ever be, a tsukemen guy.  One reason is that I always tend to get soup splattered on my shirt.But Yasube actually had bibs.  Rock on, you may make a convert out of me yet.I gotta say, though, if you are hungry, nay famished, these big thick noodles are the way to go.But, like I said, all these tsukemen shops taste the same to me.Shop Info Here  ",

You wanna eat well?  Invite me over and give me a pork chop, frying pan, and oven.  You gotta tenderize that piece of meat first and foremost.  Then you must sear it. Finally, slow roasting is necessary.  Damn, the lack of ovens in Japan means I haven't had a good pork chop in 3 years.

There is a toll system across this country on the expressways, and getting off the road is not an option.  So for gas and food they have these massive stops every 30 or 40 km.  Japanese style fast food prevails, with tempura, rice bowls, and of course ramen being prevalent.  Usually it's just a generic soy sauce ramen, but at 上里 rest stop on the Kan-Etsu Expressway there was a cool looking Hakata style shop.This shop is an extension of a shop in Tenjin, Kyushu.  You're a long way from home buddy!My lens was fogging up, it was rainy and humid out this day.  Anyways, very standard stuff.  I can't really recommend it, but it's not like you're going to go there anyways (about 2000 yen and an hour each way from Tokyo to this area on the expressway).But the fun came with a separate bowl of rice, nori seaweed, and spicy cod roe.  Finish the noodles, and dump that into your soup!Mmmmm, pinky goodness.

Or maybe it means a leisurly visit to the Tabaco and Salt Museum.  Today my Shibuya day consisted of marching in a worker's demonstration.

There are a ton of shops around the main street in Shibuya, Center-Gai, but they aren't really amazing.  But luckily, there is a less traveled-to south side with a nice ramen presence.We counted about a dozen shops within 3 minutes of each other.

If you get this, the bowl will be covered in toppings, either nori seaweed, green onions, or quail eggs... or all 3.  Having drank a bit, and eaten a lot already, we all went with the standard.Stinky and simple.  It's good stuff.  But the fun of Hakata style ramen is with the toppings.  Load em on!Let's see... we've got:Karashi Tanaka - spicy, pickled mustard greens.  Use sparingly, as some shops' versions are much more potent than others.Crushed sesame seeds - ads a nutty, creamy flavor.Benishoga - pickled red ginger gives a tangy kick.Fresh crushed garlic - it's a good thing.Before...During...After...This shop is open really late.

I did, with fellow ramen blogger Nate during my 2 hour break from teaching High School girls the wonders of my native language.For the day's lesson, I was teaching them how to sing \"We Are the World\".Is this a shop that Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen might frequent?  A real relaxed shop here, with hundreds of manga comic books and magazines along the wall.  We were actually having a random conversation about yakuza when, lo and behold, a pile of yakuza magazines.On the radio was some good tunes, old school hip hop and modern rock.Any bit of wall space that isn't covered with books is covered with photogrpahs, mostly of bands eating some late night ramen.  It turns out that this shop is near some live houses, and has become a sort of instutution for late night rocker chow.  Being Japan, live shows end at 11pm (just in time to catch your last train home).  What to do after?  Eat ramen seems logical.  That's just how we are living the rock star dream.Seriously, all the walls were covered.The owner matched the scene.  A friendly guy who made sure we were able to manage the ticket machine at the door.  After noticing our interest in taking photos, he gave us a couple RC/DC stickers.  That's Ramen Chiyosaku TakaDanobaba 3 Chome.  Cool.Do my eyes deceive me?!?Score.  I used to drink Dr. Pepper by the gallon in the States.  But I've been on a sort of diet for the last 3 years, and sugar soda is out.  Oh, this was nice.The ramen here is Yokohama style pork soup.  You can spot Yokohama style by the 3 sheets of seaweed and the addition of spinach.  Last time I had Yokohama style wasn't the best.This time was prefect.  Yokohama style seems to be a bit saltier than others, which goe good with the vegetables and extra oil.  I also had a first at this shop, un-deskinned (is that a word?) sesame seeds.I passed on the garlic and spicy miso toppings, with respect to my student who I would see in an hour.  The garlic here was pungent, anytime someone opened the top, it would hit me from across the room.  That's some proper hardcore business.Shop Info Here  ",

It's to be expected. This is, after all, the rainy season in Japan.  As always, it was sunny at some point today, so I went out without an umbrella.  This meant that to leave the shelter of the station was highly undesirable.  I looked east, I looked west, and I picked the closest ramen shop to the Inokashira line in Shibuya station.A place called Hikarihishio.The specialty here is a miso-tonkotsu-shoyu, but I didn't order that.  I saw the words ワンタン and didn't bother looking further.  Wontons!A southern style tonkotsu-shoyu soup with a little bit of spicy oil on top.  And of course, wontons thrown in.  I really wish more shops would make wontons.One small gripe was that they didn't ask me how I wanted my noodles.  I prefer them on the firm side, and these were a bit soft.  Not to worry, my kaedama, extra order of noodles, came baribari.  Perfect.This area is always bustling, and there are a good dozen or so ramen shops within a sprint from the station.  The clientele is mostly of the drunk salaryman type, but it's good to know.  It's only a 5 minute walk to the South side with it's many excellent shops, but sometimes we just can't stand the rain.Shop Info Here  ",

Have a look.Good lord, it looks like tomato sauce or something.  Is this spaghetti ramen?Nope, it's 辛辛魚らーめん, double spicy fish ramen.  The red?  That's concentrated fire.  In powder form.But spicy ramen isn't anything new, and certainly just making a comically spicy bowl wouldn't warrant a spot halfway up a Top 30 list, would it?  Let's go under the spice and see what we have.Hella fish, that's what.  The soup is made from fish and spice, and the powder on top is ground up fish powder and more spice.  It's good, real good... but...It's thick as all hell.  As soon as you mix in the powder, that oily fish kicks up the viscosity to used motor oil status.  A few reluctant sips of the left over soup was all that could be done.  As I said to Nate, I wanted to take home the extra soup and use it as a base for a curry.  It totally would have worked.  What's the deal, can I start pouring left over soup into tupperware containers?Check out a TV spot featuring some spicy ramen in Tokyo.  Inosho is the first one.Shop Info  ",

Hostess bars, pachinko parlors, game centers, and, of course, cheap food.So I found myself wandering aimlessly, and somehow ended up in ni-chome.

I love lots of toppings on my hot, raw men.  Dammit!\"Anyways, the fare here is standard Hakata stuff.  A bit lacking on the flavor scale.

Ramen in Hokkaido, or anywhere in Japan for that matter, tends to be better in the big cities.  I have a motorcycle and a tent... big cities were not on the agenda.  I didn't even stop in Sapporo for the entire month.  Don't worry, I did spend a couple days in the ramen mecca of Asahikawa.  Stay tuned.What is horumon?  As it is written in katakana, you immediately assume that it's some kind of... hormones?  The first time you eat it (horumon is common anywhere Osaka style fried stuff is served) you will only really know that it resembles meat.  Well, horu is Kansai dialect for trash, and mon is used to mean things.  So horumon is the bits that usually get thrown out.  Lips and assholes.  Nothing to do with hormones.It ain't bad, as long as you don't think about it.No, I didn't order the horumon ramen, which they did have.  Just a standard shoyu.  It was standard.  I was hungry at the time so it was fine.But the highlight was when I left.  I was getting on my bike, and a kid across the rice paddy was waving furiously at me.  So I waved back.  We were just waving for like a minute.  Then I stopped and he must have realized that he had to pee.  So he just whipped it out and took a wiz, still staring at me, waving something different this time.Yeah, this is the countryside.And so far I'm 0 for 1 with noodles here...  ",

Yes, this is a shop that caters to tourists.  It's next to the massive Kiddie Land store, with 8 stories of Japanese character goods like Hello Kitty, Mameshiba, and of course Rilakuma.  But that's for another blog.  Let's eat some ramen!    I can't recommend this spot.  It's standard stuff, but the thing that I think is whack is exactly what draws people here, the iron pot.  The soup is served in a red hot stone bowl, much like Korean bibinba.  The hot pot should keep the soup hot and tasty till the last drop.  But...  This totally threw off my ramen \"pacing\".  As ramen slowly cools, my bites become quicker, my slurps lenghtier, the silence in conversations longer.

Heavy and rich has its place, don't get me wrong.  But I wanted refreshing with a kick.  Healthy with an explosion. ばくだん means explosion, it must be meant to be.Boom!Bla-dow!  The noodles and toppings were like a fresh salad.  I could see a yoga instructor eating a plate of this with a light sesame dressing before a lesson.  But I ain't no yoga instructor!Pow!  Here it is.  The soup here is spiced up with plenty of chili and sesame.  It's as good as it looks.Smack!  For an extra buck you get your egg and a side.  I went for the rice ball, which was simple and a nice snack between spicy bites.You can get anywhere from 0 to 20 spice level.  Above 16 is \"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!\"  I went with a 5 I think, which wasn't more than a slight tang.The shop is eclectic and anyone who has lived in Hiroshima (me!) will get a kick out of all the random stuff in there.  One note though, they don't have the owari soup that you can use to mix in the dipping sauce, which is too bad I think.Nate went here too.Shop info here.  ",

A beautifully reconstructed old Japanese warehouse converted into a ramen shop, a steamy shop filled with salarymen, an hour long line for a little hole in the wall... these things make it magic.Enter Hakusan ramen.  My photos, I realize, don't portray what I want to.  Let me explain, and offer a promise to revisit in the near future.The shop opens at 9pm.  It closes at something like 4am.  This is a spot for the night crowd.  But Hakusan isn't near any sort of night life.  You could walk here in about 20 minutes from Tokyo Dome after seeing a ball game... I guess.  You could take the train way out of your way... I guess.  Or you could drive up, order some ramen, and eat in your car.  Or sit on the curb.  Or stand.  There are only 2 chairs available for the 30 or so people there.This is the reality of the place, everyone orders their ramen, either with or without egg as there are only 2 menu items, waits 20 minutes, then just sits on the curb to eat.  The curb of a semi-busy Tokyo road.  The crowd is a mix of college students (big surprise), drunk salarymen, and a host or two.  It's completely rad.  And only a 2 minute bicycle ride from my apartment.So I really really really wanted to love this ramen.  Yeah, I'm saying the first bowl did disappoint.  It was way greasy, even the bottom of the bowl had grease on it, and the chashu pork was like eating concentrated soy sauce.Maybe I jinxed it, as I had planned on going here with fellow ramen blogger Nate, but jumped the gun when a friend was visiting from out of town.  I also had high hopes, as this place is loved over at Yo! Japan.So I'll play a little game of \"fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me\" and head back here soon.Shop info here  ",

Last time I went, I was chatting online with Keizo from GoRamen just before I left.  He urged me to go to Nantsuttei.  What did I do?  I went to Rokurinsha instead.This time I followed Keizo's advice to a T.I'd been to the shop in Ikebukuro a month or so past.  But what we had here was totally out there.  Most shops created their own special just for this event.  Nantsuttei was no exception.Basil flavored noodles.  It worked really well for a sunny day eating tsukemen outside.  Totally a relaxing dish.Handed to me by Ichiro himself.This Thursday, a new group of shops comes into play.  I'm hoping to eat up Junk Garage and Nagi, at a minimum.  ",

He'll be employed at none other than top ramen shop Ivan Ramen.  Talk abut living the ramen dream!Not to steal his thunder or anything, but I'll be working for Ivan too... sort of.  From November 5th to 11th, Ivan will be selling a special tsukemen at the Big Tsukemen Fair in Hibiya.  I'll be there, serving up bowls of some amazing stuff.  Unlike the standard porky soup that is the base of most tsukemen, Ivan has concocted a chicken based soup.  It's flavorful and fresh.  Check out a preview here.I'll be there Saturday and Sunday, the 7th and 8th of November.  We start serving at 11am, and the festival ends at 9pm.  But chances are high that we will run out before the end.  Why not show up around noon, have a bowl, then go get drunk in nearby Hibiya park?The festival is outside at 日比谷パテオ, Hibita Patio, which is just outside exit A13 at Hibiya station.  You can't miss it!Once again, thats Saturday the 7th and Sunday the 8th.  いっらしゃｙませ！！！！  ",

        "post": " 大つけ博For the next 3 weeks, there is a tsukemen fair next to Hibiya park.  Some of the top shops in Tokyo all created specials just for this event.  You should go!Every week, 6 different shops will show up to feed the masses.  Grab your ticket!One ticket gets you one bowl.  I would have liked to see half size, so I could sample 2 or 3 bowls each time.  I asked the guy holding a sign which he recommends.Rokurinsha it is!  He then warned me of a 10-15 minute line.  Dude, I waited for an hour last week for TETSU, I can handle this.Turns out that Rokurinsha is the hot new spot on the scene*.  Maybe a trip to the actual shop is in the cards.No choices, just the tsukemen.Nice, some stewed pork I can option in.  Each shop had one of these last minute impulse buys.The noodles are cooked bulk, so if you are really picky, you might find fault in the mass produced method.Lots of tables set out to sit at.  Here's the final product.The noodles were really thin, which is uncommon for tsukemen.  The soup was very salty.  I saw a group of guys with a stack of beer cans in front of them.  Smart thinking!You can buy gifts for your friends.There are also some appearances by local talent.  There was this dude.I think I had seen him before on TV.  Anyways, I asked one of the cute girls who looked like his groupie.  She explained that he is on a show called シルシルミシル.  It's one of those Japanese people eating things and saying it is good shows.  He's famous with young and old alike!  Then she sold me a $3 pack of stickers.  Dude himself had no interest in talking with me though.  And from this video I found on youtube:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDMIHJOPQzg... he ain't got the highest level of charisma.Anyways, you should come to this fair between the 5th and 11th.  I'll be volunteering some of my free time to help serve up some hot bowls.  Ivan from Ivan Ramen is letting me help him out.  I'll have more info soon, stay tuned!*I've totally been here way back in the day.  I'm bad with names.Fair infoShop info  ",

This gets the obvious response, \"What is your favorite flavor of ramen?\"  The answer is easy... all of em!One of my students a few days ago lives in the same geographical area as me.  We gave each other some local recomendations.  I told him to go to Keisuke, and he told me to go to a place called Daiki, near Ueno park.  I googled mapped it and it's right across from a big Don Quixote, and I needed to buy a pot and some taco seasoning and a Haloween costume (god bless you Donki!).  It's also in the Yushima area, which is 2nd only to Kabukicho in Japanese style night entertainment.  680 yen won't get you far in this part of town... but it will get you a bowl of awesome shoyu ramen.Actually, the specialty here is とりそば, chicken salt flavor, but they often run out.  Get there early.  I want to try this chicken wonton one in the near future.Lot's of guys in there were drinking beer and having some snacks, before what I can assume to be an expensive night!Shop info here  ",

        "post": " TETSU ラーメン   I went to the very famous TESTU ramen shop almost 2 years ago.  I remember it from the kanji in for tetsu, 哲, which means philosophy.  But in ramen magazines, on ramen TV shows, and on the awning of the store, it just says TETSU.    When I saw the hour long line, I remembered the place instantly.  The 400g of hot and cold noodles.  The red hot stone you dump into your cooled down soup at the end.  And the wait.  Usually, a tsukemen place has a swift moving line.  But TETSU is no ordinary tsukemen.  This one is officially the longest I've waited.  Over 1 hour.        Still worth it.    Something I noticed this time was a \"how to eat this tsukemen\" informational sheet.  Well, it's better late than never to learn a valuable skill.  Let's go!    Hey, I'm the boss here.  Let me show you the super rad way to enjoy out tsukemen!    Tsukemen is noodles that you dip into soup.  \"It's the same as zaru soba!\"    Atsumori is noodles in hot broth.  \"Skipjack tuna flavor, yo!\"    Eat it quick!  It should sound like ZUZOZOZOZOZO.  \"Oh snap, the dipping sauce is flying everywhere!\"    If you like, there are seasonings on the counter.  \"We've got vinegar, pepper, and hot spice.\"    After eating the noodles, add some broth to dilute it.  \"Mix it the way you like it, wouldn't you agree?\"    If your soup is lukewarm, please ask for a hot stone.  \"Take it easy!\"    Put the spoon into the soup.  It should sound like JUWAWAWAWAWAW.  \"It's hot!  Be careful!\"    Drink the soup.  When you exhale it should sound like PUHAaaaa.  \"Tasty!\"  Good luck!        Shop info here.       ",

        "post": " よってこやKyoto style.  That's what my book said.  I recently bought a ramen guide to local style ramen from around Japan in Tokyo.  43 dubbed \"ramen styles\"... all available in this great metropolis.One might assume that Kyoto style would be something uber-refined.  Kaiseki ryori, Japanese haute cuisine, is analogous with Kyoto.  If you pony up to $300 for a proper kaiseki course, expect a dozen or so courses, using only the freshest of seasonal ingredients, expertly prepared by someone trained from a young age, served on immaculate dishware.This is why I was so surprised by Kyoto style ramen.A greasy, garlicky mess.Tons of suspended fat globules, which sound better if you just call it abura.  Black garlic oil.  Roasted pork.  Lets look at the details.The soup was ok.  Pretty basic for this porky style.  The addition of the garlic oil was a plus.The charred pork on top was great.  Crispy and tender at the same time.  A+.The noodles were some of the worst I'd had in Japan.  I think they used a 20 cent bag of instant noodles.  It really killed the dish.You can choose black, white, or red.  Mine is the black.Nate from Waseda Ramen had the spicy red.  He wasn't impressed either.Shop info here.  ",

But they were closed, taking a few days to head up to the annual Nagano ramen festival.  So Nate from Waseda Ramen and I found the closest ramen of quality, a place called Koshinbo.Nate said to me, and I paraphrase here, \"I think there's a shop around here with only chicks serving ramen created by a chick.\"Ramen being a very \"guy\" thing in Japan, we had to check this out.This could go one of two ways.A bunch of fat, drooling dudes coming to idolize the ladies serving up their favorite sustenance.A female friendly shop that anyone is comfortable inLuckily #2 was the reality.  They even have a ladies set which comes with salad.  I left my wig at home, so I had to get the standard.  Nate added cheese to his, and I went with an extra serving of the house menma.Well done ladies.  A very solid bowl.Nozu Rie, the owner here, really made a bowl that anyone could get behind.  And for someone who is high on the ramen fame-o-meter, she is surprisingly humble, clearing tables and welcoming people to the store.  Usually, the more famous a shop gets, the meaner the master's grimace gets.  It's nice to see nice food for the nice people.I had no idea, but this is #30 on my outdated Top 30 in Japan list.  Keep in mind, everyone's a critic and there are at least 3 major top of the game lists that come out in various publications or TV shows each month out here.Shop info here.  ",

The lively Akamon street in the Osu-Kannon area of Nagoya could be akin to Tokyo's Akihabara.  This means nerdy.  Toy shops, maid cafes, and robots.  Is there any human task a robot can't do?  Not in this country!    Yep, these are the infamous ramen robots.  R2B1 is the manager, and R2B2 is the assistant manager.  Working in harmony, they can get a bowl to you in less than 2 minutes.  Together they make this:    It's a fairly normal tonkotsu pork soup.  Nothing amazing, but you're not really here for an exceptional bowl of ramen, are you?  On with the show!    Everything is automated, from placing the bowl, to pouring the soup, to shaking the noodles.    All to the whizz and whir or precision electronics.    During downtime they joke away with some typical manzai comedian jokes.  Slapstick is essential.  A quarrel over the fairer of the robot sexes leads to a knife battle.    Despite the huge number of people walking around this area, the shop was relatively quiet.  No line, we walked right in and sat down.    It's only a couple stops from the central Nagoya station.  But if you are in a rush, keep in mind that there is a ramen \"street\" right in the station for all your eating needs.    But when the robots attack (they eat old people's medicine for fuel), I'll feel good knowing I gave some love to the first robot ramen chefs on the planet.

But Keizo from goramen.com and I both had long nights, and decided to take it easy on the traveling.  Instead of an hour north, we met in Ebisu.Tsukumo has been on the radar for a while now.  The number one menu item is a cheese miso ramen.  But unlike other places that just pile some cheese on top, Tsukumo blends it into the already rich soup.... and they pile it on top!  They use what they call トムチーズ, which is some kind of sharp cheeese.It's rich, creamy, and awesome.Tsukumo provides you with a ton of free toppings.  Adding a bit of spice was a good choice.Once I sat down they gave me the English menu.  I usually frown upon that, but this menu is so covered in Engrish that I'll overlook it this time.On the back is a Korean menu.  Any Korean speakers out there want to comment on their translation?They have lunch time deals for those out during the daylight hours.  The ramen came with your choice of free rice, nori seaweed, or egg.  This 200 yen set looks nice, but I didn't feel the need.This one had to be slurped down to the last drop.  It was a little strong though, and my stomach had a little bit of a battle an hour later.  But I'm happy to say that the body prevailed.Also, there is a cool seat outside.  Enjoy the weather and people watching if you get the chance.Official SiteSupleks Database Info  ",

Usually, the only adventure here is finding your friends.  When I first moved to Japan, 3 foreigners tried to meet for the first tiem in Shinjuku station.  Agreeing to meet at the \"Starbucks\" is not a wise choice.  Now I'm wiser, and chose the SE exit.  I wandered around the block 3 times before finding this little 2nd floor shop with a name meaning Poseidon.The god of the sea would approve, assuming he eats seafood.  Does the great Neptune feast on the inhabitants of his realm?This is the second time in a week that I've had a simple salt broth with some sort of unique topping.  With a flavor and texture similar to something you'd find at a dim sum restaurant, these dumplings are made with a long list of fruits of the sea.Anyone know what 日本のアラ, Japanese Ara, is?I had the spicy soup.  You can choose your level.  Medium was fine.Putting a fried rice ball in the soup seems to be the new trend with this type of light soup.Kaijin is woman owned, and I caught a glimpse of the owner in the back, barking orders at a couple of young punks.  Not a bad gig though, if you ask me.All this light ramen lately!  That's what I get for going to shops featured in a book called \"Girl's Ramen Club\".

After a couple of beers at my favorite beer pub in Nakameguro, nothing is better than some tsukemen from Mitsuyado.The double cheese tsukemen is a crowd pleaser.  When I explained the size options to my friend J, I explained about nami (normal), chu (medium), and omori (big).  But there are other options present.  Tokumori I've seen before.  It translates to special size.  Then there was a new one... kiwamori... extreme size.  Keep in mind that 250 grams of noodles is standard.  A hungry appetite should go for the big size.  But at a whopping 1500 grams, kiwamori is for special occasions.Like today.  My buddy ain't from around here.  Both the waiter and I double checked his want for over 3 pounds of noodles.  His logic, beautifully stated, \"It's only an extra 400 yen... and I'm hungry!\"Word from the staff is that 2 or 3 people order this a day.2 hours later, and he's still alive.  Let's see if he makes it through the night.  ",

        "post": " 鮎ラーメンEvery Tuesday night I find myself in Futakotamagawa, a station about 20 minutes west of Shibuya.  The key here is in the station, as I teach a private English lesson at a cafe inside the station gates.  After the hour, I hop back on the train, and since I never technically left the station, I save big on the train fare.  But today I left the gates, paying the $4 fare, in search of an adventure in a new part of town and some noodles.Futakotamagawa is amazingly upscale.   Name brand goods only.  The streets are cobblestone.  The restaurants are... fancy.  That goes for ramen too.Ayu ramen is exactly what it's name suggests, ramen with ayu.  Ayu is the name of the Japanese Sweetfish.  If you've ever been in the countryside near a river, you'll see it being grilled in abundance, and eaten from a skewer.  It's so delicate, that you can eat the whole thing, bones and all, without issue.  Be warned, though, that it's often cooked with the innards still inside.  You probably don't want to bite into that!Here, it's been de-gutted.  The ayu is given a quick char.The noodles are given a quick boil.And the finished product.The soup is a very simple broth, with almost no flavor, just warmth.  The reason is obvious, to bring out the ayu.  A strong soup would simply overpower the light fish taste.I found this shop in my \"Girl's Ramen Club\" book.  Totally a relaxing place.You can order a fried rice ball to toss in the left over soup, as the chef recommended.At the end, he brought me a glass of house blended jasmine tea.I asked the staff what shop they recommended I go to next, and not surprisingly they said MIST.  I say not surprising, because Ayu and MIST are two of the most expensive shops in my guidebook.  Not crazy expensive, just about double what you'd pay at a more run of the mill place.Official site hereShop info here  ",

Businessmen, offices, and of course food.  Simply choosing what to eat after a 14 hour work day can be an adventure.  Lucky for me, I've got guidebooks.Yeah, that sign says they are open from 8 in the morning.  It's true, ramen for breakfast is totally cool if you are in a suit.  Despite it's location and obvious clientele, Taizan came recommended in my latest ramen guidebook, titled 女子ラーメン... ramen for chicks.The top billed item is a salt broth topped with fried sakura ebi, cherry blossom shrimp.  I've had sakura ebi on a few occasions, and they are wonderful.  If you are squemish about eating the whole shrimp, stay away.  These guys are so small that there is no other way.But first, take in the atmosphere.  Old baseball memoribilia on all 4 walls.Here it is.  The fried shrimp is excellent.  Fried food often tops thicker udon noodle dishes, but seldom ramen.  It's good, real good.  It adds a very fried flavor to the soup, which I could see being a problem with some people.Not with me though.The dark mass on the left is their spice blend.  A mix of tumeric, coriander, and garam masala.  It's awesome, but a little on the light side.  I could have gone with about 3 times the amount to give more of a kick.Noodles done, you'll be left with a mushy combination of fried batter, tiny shrimps, and soup.Add rice.Remember, adding rice once the noodles are gone turns one meal into two.The place was virtually empty except for Nate and I, and our visitors.  Before we left, a lone host, looking fashionable and hungry, slumped into a corner with his cell phone, texting away to god knows who.And I checked another off my list.Shop info here  ",

I had tried to go a few weeks ago, but Monday was the day off, and I wanted to go on a Monday.  Since the 30th of December was the absolute last day to try this, it had to be done.Nate of ramenate.com's description of the shop, sent via a series of text messages while waiting in line and after eating, completely sold me.  Let the picture speak for itself!The creamy side, on the left, was made with all sorts of seafood, including clams and shrimp.  It reminded me of the rice congee porridge that is popular in Korea and China.  Thick and luscious.The other side was flavored with what tasted like shoyu and sesame oil.Two thin slices of kabocha, Japanese pumpkin, was a nice touch.The stewed pork was nothing short of amazing.  It tasted like beef jerky.  Not the crap you get at Costco either, but the homemade countryside beef jerky that you find out in the middle of nowhere on road trips.800 yen for a bowl... if you don't like to write.  If you create a simple message using the word Futo (it means fat), then you can eat for 650 yen.Some of the past customer's messages.Mine.  Fat-tastic!The staff was having a great time.  Recently, I've really been noticing the dynamics of the staff at popular ramen shops.  Some are serious, and all about getting business done.  But others are just having fun, laughing, and loving the ramen life.  Shops leaning towards the latter get big props from me.Nate's EntryMore Shop Info Here  ",

Besides having regular fare, they make a yasai (vegetable) tsukemen that looks gorgeous.  Check this out:Yeah, I had to make the trip out for this.  I can count at least 8 different kinds of vegetables.  Some of the vegetables were cooked in boiling water, alongside the noodles, to make them tender.The soup I ordered was a shio dipping sauce.  It was okay, but I think the regular style tsukemen soup looked better.Eating it was a challenge.  Do I dip the big piece of lettuce into the hot soup and eat it?  Should I eat noodles and carrot in the same bite?The atmosphere of the shop was like a cozy neighborhood cafe.  I'd totally hang out here if I lived around the corner.And, by the way, the name camino has no special meaning to the store.

Actually, I was touring someone around to some top Tokyo ramen shops.The ramen at Nagi in Shibuya is always a winner.  The goal of the day was to take photos, eating was second priority.Since they were all repeat bowls up to this point, I had to go off on my own and try a new shop.  More on Camino in my next post.And, as always, we ended the night at Bassanova.I've had some very unique ramen adventures in the past couple of months.  And I'll talk about it... in due time.We now return you to your regularly scheduled ramen shop reviews.  ",

No way, I had to go with the limited edition \"Mexican Chili Mazemen\"Basically taco rice ramen.  Taco rice, for those not in Japan, is taco beef, lettuce, and tomato served on a bed of rice.  It's awesome by he way.  As were these noodles.Ivan didn't just pop a packet of Mexican seasonings onto some noodles.  Dried chilies and spices imported from the States were a key ingredient.So good, though I wanted to add my own hot sauce and dip some tortilla chips in, once the noodles were done.Mexico + Texas = Tex-Mex.Tex-Mex + Ramen = ....

        "post": " 山小屋My first choice for ramen in the Kiyosumishirokawa area of Tokyo was... well I forgot my map today.  My ramen map.  My ramen map, while doubling as just a regular detailed map of Tokyo neighborhoods, has a list of shops I want to go to.   So what was to be a ramen adventure turned into a search for something that... exists.   I lack internet search capabilities on my phone, so strolling around was the only option.   Anything would do.I'd seen the storefront for Yamagoya before.  All 5 stories of it to be exact.  I wonder what kind of ramen they might have?  With a whole floor of signage devoted to 九州, the mystery is short lived.Good bowl of creamy Kyushu tonkotsu, good price.  Nothing amazing or inventive, but that's usually what you get from a massive chain of hundreds of shops.  This one had seats for about 20 people, and over half were full.  I should also note that this was Christmas Eve, so only single Japanese guys were here, as Eve is more important than Valentine's Day for couples in Japan.  And couple don't do ramen, at least not on the number one romantic day of the year.  They should, but they don't.Random, but it looks like Yamagoya has ventured into Thai territory, opening shops in Bankok.  And backed by the boss of Singha beer.Fitting, as most single white guys living in Japan spend the holiday season abroad in Thailand.Official Website HereMore Shop Info HereNate from Ramenate went there  ",

        "post": " すーぷ道 連A text message on my phone from Nate had me drooling. He was waiting in a long line at Futo, and offered me a lengthy description.  My thoughts raced.   Dreams of 2 kinds of soup.   Visions of an epic collaboration between ramen experts.   An image of deliciousness.   Limited run until the end of 2009.But they were closed on Monday.   My friend J quickly searched his memory for plan B.   Plan B was tsukemen at Supudo Ren, close to my apartment in Bunkyo.Solid, normal tsukemen.The addition of some wasabi (can't remember if it was flavored with yuzu citrus fruit or not) was good.Yum, it's normal tsukemen soup.Talking with Nate yesterday, he has come up with a theory about tsukemen.  Let me paraphrase.  Besides the few inventive tsukemens like Keisuke Yondaime, almost all tsukemen is the same.  A thick pork and fish soup to dip your huge noodles in.  But the subtle differences that make ramen so amazing are almost unnoticeable in tsukemen.  Therefore, tsukemen is not an alternative to ramen, but an alternative to udon or soba, which are commonly eaten cold and dipped in the soup.  And the other commonality is that almost all soba and udon tastes the same.  Nourishing noodles, but you almost always know exactly what you are going to get when you step into an udon shop in Japan.What do you think of this thought?  In 2009, tsukemen really blew up on the ramen scene in Tokyo.  But, to me, each bowl was akin to the last.  This is in no way a bad thing, as I gotta say that tsukemen is completely comforting.And the trend for 2010?  Apparently it's going to be light, refined tastes.  Lots of clear salt broth ramen.More Shop Info Here  ",

I was trying to remember the way to Gogyo, as we were walking in the horrid part of Tokyo known as Roppongi, but she wasn't having any of my adventurous ramen hunting antics.  We stopped in at this place, which happened to be the nearest thing in line of sight.It's a chain place.  There's one in Shibuya, one in Roppongi, and another near Tokyo station.  This is a bad point, as those are all just places to get unknowing suckers to come to the store.  Even worse, unknowing drunk suckers, as these are spots for plentiful boozing and, minus the Tokyo area, all night clubbing.For a boring, underachieving bowl.The ramen here is not recommended.  Drunk club goers in Roppongi might stumble in here at all hours of the night, but I don't want to be part of that.  The shop even smelled bad, but that could be said of most tonkotsu ramen shops.Turns out Gogyo was about 3 minutes walk from this spot.It's been a bad couple weeks for stinky Kyushu style ramen it seems.More Shop Info Here  ",

        "post": " あ、ガッチャ麺This is maybe the closest shop to my apartment.  But we decided to take the longer, more adventurous route to get there.First on Keizo, Nate, and I's hit list was Nishio, a hot newcomer on the scene.  Luckily we checked beforehand, and avoided showing up at a closed shop.  So we started walking.  The number two, decided by a hurried research session online, was on holiday as well.  Next was a sort of \"Asian\" noodle place nearby that was voted down upon arrival.  The last option, before resorting to Sengoku Jiman, was just down the road.a, Gacchamen is the name.  That's a small あ at the front, by the way.  You'll be treated to a decent miso if you come here.  The added yuzu wasabi and ginger kick it up a notch.  Here is the basic:But I took it even further.  You see, Ebisu, the god of wealth and fortune was smiling on me today.  I had just setup and paid for www.ramenate.com, Nate's new website name.  The deal was simple.  You buy my domain, and I'll buy your next bowl.  And it just so happened that a, Gacchamen has an 1800 yen bowl.  That's like $20!Of course, anything this special is going to make the ramen pages of a few magazines.  But what is it?  ワイントン, Wine-ton.What the hell is Wine-ton?Let me explain.  As the swine is raised, it is fed a healthy amount of... wine.  These booze enhanced pigs have more supple, tender meat.  It's true that you can soak meat in liquor to tenderize it some, but this is taking it to another level.Another level is a good place to go to.The meat is lean and tender, almost buttery.  This is the kobe beef of the other white meat world.  But it comes at a price.  Each slice adds almost $5 to the total.  That's big money for a bite of meat.  At least when it comes to ramen prices that is.The staff was happy to show me the pricey cut of meat.And stop for the photo that is becoming a standard on this site.Official Blog HereMore Shop Info Here  ",

        "post": "   Welcome New York Times readers!  Nope, that's not me in the above photo, but none other than the Frugal Traveler, Matt Gross.  Matt emailed me sometime last year about lending him a hand with an article he was writing, and I jumped at the chance.  If there's one thing I love as much as eating ramen, it's introducing people to great ramen shops in Tokyo.    Well, the article is out online, and in the upcoming January 31st print edition of the NY Times.  I expect a bit more traffic here, so I'll drop a little Q&A.  Photos are all from the time that Matt and photographer Basil Childers were out in Tokyo with me.    Why Ramen? As an American who went to college, I ate my share of 10 for a dollar instant noodles.  Not a pleasant memory.  When I came to Japan almost 4 years ago, I had the real deal.  Handmade noodles, broth that is simmered for days, secret ingredients; this is good stuff.  Not only is it good food, but there is a whole \"culture\" behind it in Japan, with hour long lines, TV shows, and hype for days.  I caught the bug, began eating at 3 or 4 new shops a week, and started this site.    What's up with this blog? Eating ramen and taking photos are two passions of mine.  Back in October of 2008 I started writing up each ramen shop I went to.  I was unemployed at the time, and with tons of free time on my hands (and not a lot of cash for expensive meals) I started eating a lot of ramen.  Ramen is actually considered a hobby by some people in Japan.  I'm one of those people.    I'm coming to Tokyo, where should I eat ramen?  What's the best shop? That is the number one question I get.  Matt and I went to most of my favorite shops, so you can refer to his NY Times article here.  But honestly, just browse through some of my posts and look at the pictures.  I'm no wordsmith, but luckily if ramen looks great, it usually tastes great.  Some of my favorites at the moment are:  Ganko for the experience. Gogyo for a fun, trendy experience. Tetsu if you want to wait in a huge line that is totally worth it. Ivan Ramen for the best noodles around.Bassanova is my favorite undiscovered spot... for now!  If you want some other perspectives, check out my buddies and fellow Tokyo ramen lovers Nate's site www.ramenate.com or Keizo's site at www.goramen.com.    Did you really lose weight eating ramen? I've lost about 45kg while living in Japan.  Yeah, I went from 260lbs to around 170lbs in a couple years.  Seriously, cut out sugar, especially refined corn syrup, and you will be on your way to your goal.  Just replace sweets with ramen!  Are you bald? I have a healthy head of curly hair, thank you very much!  I just keep it shaved so it doesn't fall into my bowls of noodles.    I want to come live / work / travel in Japan, help me! Fell free to email me at macduckston at gmail dot com with any non-ramen related inquiries.  I know a bit about teaching English and riding motorcycles.    Are you going to open a ramen shop or something? For the time being I'm happy just eating.  Check out Keizo's blog to see what life for a ramen shop worker is like.  You never know though...    How can I help your ramen adventures (dot com)? Suggest shops to me!  Every shop that someone recommends gets marked in my Tokyo street atlas and visited at some point.  Have a bowl with me!  If you're in Tokyo, I would love to get a bowl of ramen with you, as long as I can fit it into my crazy work schedule.  You don't mind long lines, do you?  Comment with your own ramen adventures!  Hanging with celebs at Ippudo in New York?  Shoulder to shoulder with yakuza gangsters at some little shop in countryside Japan?  Concocting your own ramen recipe?  Let everyone know!   Thanks again for visiting.  You can subscribe over on the left.  Oh, Matt just posted the article to twitter, I'd better post this!     ",

This time, though, everyone was a little busy so we just decided for something local.  Koenji is a really cool part of town, close to everyone, and full of ramen.    The new Koenji Ramen Street is the talk of the town.  4 top shops competing for the longest line.  Of course, Tetsu's is the longest.  But don't worry, it's nothing like the 90 minute wait at the main shop.    We felt more like something new.  Tabushi was near the station, and boasted some great looking \"Black Tantanmen\".  You had me at spicy.    This was some great tantanmen.  Just enough kick to be safe for anyone.  The soup was thick and full of ground pork.    Nate, who doesn't eat pork (in solid meat form), always gives me his slice.  But he mistook his pile of menma for grilled, chopped chashu.  It was really good, sorry Nate!    Keizo added the gyoza, solid.    This shop is a winner.  Good for anytime eating, but this would be the ultimate hangover food.  Fortunately, I hadn't been drinking the night before (can't speak for my friends though!)    I took a photo of this young mom with a baby strapped to her back, and grandma gave me a crazy stare-down.  Sorry!  I think a back pack baby in a ramen shop is fair game for photos though.

Both fall under some sort of \"apple\" moniker.  Though on the radar, \"Apple Temple\" was kicked up by a recommendation from Nate.  So while he was off in Korea, Keizo and I did the lunch bowl.A tasty egg is nothing new, but Ringodo boasts the \"number 1 egg in Japan\".  At about double the price of an egg at other ramen shops, this better be good!I went with the B set, a bowl of miso ramen and a bowl of rice with a raw \"number 1\" egg thrown on top.  Very \"Japanese\" indeed.In Japan, the fear of eggs is non-existent.  Eggs are sold unrefrigerated in the supermarket, and served raw on any dish you could think of.  Don't be surprised if that pizza you just ordered has a big raw egg in the middle.This is definitely nouveaux miso ramen.  Forget your powerful Sapporo style, Ringodo serves up a more refined taste.  A bit sweet, maybe there are actual apples in the soup.  One thing that could either be a plus or a minus was the thickness.  This soup is really really thick.Can anyone decipher the store's shirt (available for 3000 yen... no thanks).  Higashinakano is the station.  I got that.  But, Underground Too Mach.  If you can somehow relate that sentence to apples and miso, I'll buy you a 200 yen egg!  Bonus points if you reference the Mach 5.More shop info here  ",

        "post": " 西尾中華そば    Just a few minutes from my place in Bunkyo (kind of a trend with my ramen adventures lately) is a winner.  Ramen Walker magazine gave it the bronze in their ranking of new 2009 shops.  Anything in the top 3, or top 30 for that matter, is in my sights.    So I headed over for a bowl of their shoyu ramen.  I've been on a shoyu spree lately, hitting up Tsukishima Rock and Kokaibo in the last week.  How does Nishio stack up?    They should have taken the gold.  This is good eats.  The secret lies in the double soup.  A chicken soup paired with a fish soup.  In fact, the logo shows a chicken, fish, and... corn?  What's that about?    The noodles are made in the same plant that cranks out corn tortillas for the taco industry.  If you live in Tokyo, you probably have come across tacos zero times, give or take once.  Regardless, why not throw a little of that maize flour in with the noodles.  Seems logical.    Mr. Nishio, the chef behind the counter, did his training with Nagi.  Nagi's approach to ramen is to open completely different shops, like the Shibuya, Tachikawa, and Shinjuku shops.    If you ever need a hint what to order, look for the osusume, recommendations.    Nishio-san recommends a bowl of the standard ramen, toss in the egg, a bowl of buta meshi (that's some fried pork on rice), and a cold beer.  That combo deal will run you less than $15.    The beer is proper Brau Meister, Kirin's answer to real beer (dont get me started on the widely available Japanese beer), and only 350 yen.  If I didn't have to teach an English lesson an hour later I would have been all over it.  But at least I can try the rice bowl.   Official Blog Here More Shop Info Here        ",

        "post": " 月島ロックJust around the corner from Tsukishima's Monja Street, where you have your choice of around 50 monja shops, is some ramen.  This is Tokyo though, and just around the corner from anything is a ramen shop.I forewent the monja for the first time in 3 weeks (I am here weekly for an English lesson) and had a bowl of this superb shoyu soup.But getting there was 90% of this adventure.Things started out at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo near Kiyosumi station.  Nice place, but skip the overpriced exhibitions and just check out the permanent collection.Checking page 99 of my handy Tokyo Street Atlas, I noticed I had marked a spot not to far away.  Menya Kisso.Which is only open for lunch.  And closed on Wednesdays and Sundays.  Remember that!It's always acceptable practice to dip  into the nearest convenience store to look at their ramen magazines.And tie over the hunger with a Pac-Man streamed bun.Mmmmm.  Like a Pac-Man who just ate the big dot, I was headed straight for my destination.  Tsukishima is only 2 stops away.And here's Tsukishima Rock.  This shop is related to the popular 69 'N Roll One out in Machida.  (6 = Ro and 9=Ku... Roku)  Without knowing that info though, you might think this place is some sort of music venue / bar / hip noodle joint.Exhibit A, booze.  Exhibit B,Rock records and guitars hanging on the walls.  There was some Beatles and Floyd playing at medium volume on the stereo.  Turn it up guys!You've got a couple choices here.  I went with the standard shoyu.  Made with some ginger, it's a simple taste that smells superb.  That's hardly surprising.  69 'N Roll One is very well known for their simple shoyu perfection.My friend P had the more complex 8/6, hachirocku.  A lot of different fruits of the sea go into this one. Both are great with the yuzu tinted shichimi from Nagano.Even though the decor was fresh, the music bumping, and the ramen rad, this place was dead!  And almost every seat was filled.  Everyone was doing the ramen-stare, just waiting quietly until their food came.Which is too bad, because that's obviously not what they are going for.  Besides the ramen, there are some upscale snacks available, like Italian salami slices and a seasonal cheese plate.  And enough bottles to concoct any cocktail you could think of.  If it had been a little noisier, a little more upbeat, I could easily have bought the 1600 yen mixed appetizer platter and a couple beers.Then again, maybe it was my timing.  It was around 6 in the evening, in no way party time.Since it's next to my weekly English lesson, I'll stop by a little later next time.  Cheers!Official Site HereMore Shop Info Here  ",

        "post": " こうかいぼうFinding a great shop can be an adventure, or a complete cinch.  The easiest way to eat good is to simply look at a reputable magazine or website's ranking, and pick a top shop.  This time it was the #4 ramen from ultra database Supleks.jp.  Not to be confused with Bret Hart's signature suplex finishing move.The rankings can be misleading though, especially in Japan.  I'm not sure about the supleks ranking logistics, but if a shop is mentioned by someone famous on TV, it will suddenly be everyone's favorite.  If a member of AKB48 says she likes even the worst of ramen shops, you can bet the next day every otaku in town will be there.All that said, I'm a sucker for rankings.  I read them all, and make notes in my Tokyo street atlas.  That's how I got to Kokaibo, which is near a lesson I teach.Made from pork, chicken, konbu, fish, and many many vegetables.  That may sound like the recipe at 90% of shops, but it's the proportions that count.  I love that they list this stuff out for me.  They even mention that the water is from a Seagull IV, which sounds horrible, but is just a type of water purification system.The set comes with a small rice and raw egg.  There was also a set with a bowl of fried pork rice, which looked really good.The ramen was a simple thing, reminding me a lot of Ikaruga.  I had my first taste.Perfect.  Some sweetness to it.  Then... something was different.  Not wrong, but different.The soup has almost no aftertaste.  I've never, in all my bowls, been left with the taste of... water.  My bowl of similar looking ramen the day before lingered for hours.  This one had been suplexed, and was down for the count.The whole lack of aftertaste thing works great here.  You really taste the noodles.  And the subtle initial flavors aren't crushed by a garlicky power.  Ramen rankers of Supleks, well ranked.More Shop Info Here  ",

Not really a ramen zone, but more of an entertainment and food zone, the area out the West Exit of Ikebukuro should be visited by anyone looking for some interesting food.The trademark bone and black tarp, of course.The view from the chairs outside.  No line today, but the shop was full inside. RameNate and I had to wait for about 10 minutes.  Who else has waited at this same shop, you might ask?  Good question.  Maybe you've heard of a man called...... Kenny G?And... Martha Stewart?  A veritable A list of Hollywood's best.The master kindly requests that you, the ramen manic eating at this popular shop, put away your magazine and cell phone when your soup gets here.  The last line is great. \"From a nice old man who likes ramen!\"Presenting the nice, ramen loving old man!I had the shio, even though my ticket was for the shoyu.  It's hard to decide who has the best shio ramen, the Ganko shops, or Ivan.  Best to keep eating at both.  I preferred the Baba Ganko one a little though, the green chilies you could add were a perfect addition. The shoyu was no slouch either.Once a month, they serve a \"special\" shio ramen.  All the Ganko shops do this, a special once a month thing.  Stay tuned!More Shop Info Here  ",

But these days ramen soup has crossed into the realm of anything goes.Then is it the noodles?  The addition of kansui is what gives ramen noodles it's difference from many western noodles.  But in these modern times of the magic of science, we can simulate this naturally occurring sodium carbonate with ease.So where do you draw the line?It doesn't really matter, as long as you're enjoying the adventure!Taiyo Tomato is a chain with a dozen or so shops, all serving up a tomato soup with angel hair-esque noodles.  They are really into a healthy image, using a lot of natural ingredients, and relying on the nutrition of tomatoes to draw in customers.Not sure how healthy my bowl, which was covered in parmesan cheese, was.

The shop they introduced to New York City simply blew up, becoming somewhat of a sensation.  But this is a site about ramen in Japan, so let's keep it local.Ippudo is no slouch in Japan.  Over 40 shops dot the landscape, with plenty in Tokyo.  I used to frequent the Kichijoji shop when I lived there, though I haven't been much since I moved away.  But today was no ordinary Ippudo bowl of creamy tonkotsu ramen.  This was the newly created COLLECTION.MISO.With signage that looked like something out of The Matrix, my interests were piqued.  Would I choose the red pill or the white pill?Just like the standard Ippudo, there is the regular white and more adventurous red.  I dipped my spoon into the bright bowl of miso Akamaru.  How was this highly anticipated slurp?Not bad.  The miso taste here is very light, and a little sweet.  But just a bit too... safe.A lot of miso ramen shops go for broke, shoving a ton of flavor in your face.  Some fail, some succeed.  Few sit right in the middle.The noodles are different than the skinny hakata style noodles you normally get at Ippudo (though if you order the kaedama, an extra helping of noodles, you'll be given the classic).  Thick, meant for miso noodles fit the bill quite nicely.My new friends N and C tried the white.  Not sure why only the white came with grated ginger.Even though COLLECTION.MISO won't be making any top ten lists of mine, it was a good bowl.  And one thing about these noodles:Official Site Here (awesome design)More Shop Info Here  ",

They've opened shop at the newly opened Tokyo Ramen Street, sponsored a recent tsukemen festival, and now are offering a version of their tsukemen at Tokyo 7-11's.This isn't dried noodles, and it's even a step beyond the common vacuum packed nama noodles that you can sometimes find.  This is already cooked.  Just nuke it and you are ready to go.Rokurinsha's noodles (at the real shop) are downright amazing.  So I was interested in how they could recreate them.  Some sort of jelly substance is sitting on the cold noodles.The soup and toppings come in a separate bowl.  Heavily gelled in the cold form.Just pop it all into the microwave and enjoy.But I don't have a microwave.  I only have my high tech $1000 steam oven.  So I set it to reheat rice mode and let it do it's magic.The soup melted nicely.As did the Styrofoam container for the noodles.It was a solid lunch.  For only 498 yen, I could possibly eat this more often.  But I won't.  There's very little adventure in sitting at home eating instant noodles.  ",

This is (apparently) soul food.This spot was dubbed Best Shoyu in the World by Keizo from GoRamen.  That's a crazy title, considering that he has slurped countless bowls of soy sauce rich ramen.Inside the shop, some vintage soul food posters adorn the walls.  Often, shops that do this sort of thing in Japan do so in poor taste.  I've seen old timey black-face countless times in this country.  But Jiraigen pulls it off as a really chill spot.On Fridays you can try a special black ramen made with squid ink.  Unfortunately, Friday is not a day for ramen, at least until my schedule changes.The pots are steaming, and my order is up.A solid shoyu, accentuated by the freezing cold February morning.I'll say it now, I disagree with Keizo on this one.  It was good and all, but shortly after eating I felt a layer of chicken fat coating my taste buds.  I've noticed this lately with a lot of shoyu, the heavy chicken fat flavor.  I really really don't go for it.The egg was superb though.As were the rest of the toppings.  A++ on that menma!So although its not on the top of my list, this spot should be visited just on the rad factor.  The music, by the way, is awesome here.Official Site HereMore Shop Info Here  ",

Menya Musashi is up there on the list.  Bakudan is an unexpected favorite.  But today was an adventure in spicy.  A Scoville excursion if you will.You know, if there is a massive piece of calligraphy art that roughly translates to \"Spicy and Delicious\", surrounded by famous people's autograph plaques, that you are in for something good.And you'd be right.The Gomoku (mashup of different things) Mongolian style tantan men is rad.  Each bite is just enough substance, just enough spicy.  There is also a North Pole ramen on the menu, which might knock you on your behind.  Since I had to teach in 30 minutes, I opted for safety.Down to the last red hot drop.Official Site HereMore Shop Info Here  ",

        "post": " ジャンクガレッジBeyond all measures of a doubt, today was what ramen adventurers search for.  Not just the noodles at the end of the road, but the road itself.  All the better if that road has a few bumps; a few dead ends; maybe a train museum or two.The day started out normal enough.  The original plan was to visit Junk Garage, way up past Omiya, at their opening time, 11:30am, and then move about 30 minutes west to Kawagoe.  These strange and foreign place names are major cities in Saitama, Tokyo's less than savory neighbor to the north.  Often called Dasaitama, a play on words indicating the extreme uncoolness of the prefecture.But the trains from Omiya to Higashi-Omiya, a mere 6 minutes away, were all stopped.  \"At least an hour,\" said an apologetic station worker.  Translation... more like 2.So Nate, of the accidentally popular ramenate.com (thanks NY Times!) and I, of the accidentally popular ramenadventures.com (thanks NY Times!) set off for something to kill time with.  Maybe a nice cafe near the station.  Perhaps browsing at a nearby bookstore.  Not when there is the new (relatively) Japan Railways Train Museum within walking distance!2.5 hours later (we could have stayed longer) and we were back on the train.With a few of our close friends.  Smashed in like sardines, it's a good thing we hadn't eaten anything yet.Now for the ramen.  I had attempted to eat here a few months back, riding my motorcycle for 1 hour, only to find it was the day off.  This time we knew they were open.  And we knew they closed at 3:00.  Due to the train nonsense, it was now after 2:30.  I know time is of the essence, but I gotta take this photo!Just past the questionable sign for \"Ramen Land\", we got lost a bit, but then somehow ended up approaching the back parking lot of our destination.  Success!  Japanese heavy metal music on the stereo, welcome to Junk Garage.Cheering and high-fiving, we both settled in for the Special mazesoba, big size. This is soup-less ramen, but that doesn't even begin to describe it.You've gotta start with the word Junk.  This has actually become a little more of a mainstream word lately, but it's basically food that is covered with all kinds of tastiness.  There's a very high chance it will look horrid.  There's an even higher chance that all of the customers will be men.  What kind of junk are we talking about:Garlic, pork fat, and cheese are optional along with a raw egg, spicy shrimp mayonnaise, baby star crispy noodles, bonito fish flakes, and their own special spice mix.  Are you ready?Wow!Good god!Thank you!This is good stuff.  The cheese, the fat, the high quality soy sauce.  It all comes together.  Layers upon layers of flavor.  If you could add a pastry cover, something to hide the junk, this would pass as a gourmet gastronomical masterpiece.It should be noted that the noodles here are of extreme high quality.  Junk Garage has a relationship with Rokurinsha, the hottest tsukemen noodle place in Tokyo, and they use noodles from the same place.We talked about what other junk might go well on top.  Nate said crushed up Doritos.  Cool Ranch Doritos, I added.  I'll be back, as the shop is open until 3 am.  3am!  In the warmer months, riding my motorcycle up to dasaitama, Doritos in my camera bag.And check out the video I made from my \"ram-cam\" head mounted video camera.

There's something about drinking culture in Japan that is almost a given.  2 or 3 or 10 drinks later, and someone, without fail, will make the suggestion... ramen.We could have walked for 5 minutes to the consistently good Sengoku Jiman.  But why walk 5 when you can walk 1?  Enter Sugamo Ramen.  In Sugamo.  Never mind the creative naming.  It's next to the station.The pot hides a creamy tonkotsu soup.  You can choose from a shoyu or shio flavor.  The shio was recommended.Soup brimming with floating fat globules, it's a Sengoku Jiman clone.The soup was rather weak, though if you want you can order it stronger.  The soy saturated pork on the other hand is quite salty.A fairly standard egg comes with every bowl.Not a bad bowl, but no where near as rad as Sengoku Jiman.  Location may be key, though, since Sugamo Ramen is next to the station as well as next to a nice seedy alley where *ahem* anything goes.Maybe you get a text message.\"Honey, where are you?  I'll be in Sugamo soon.\"By the time you type your reply, you're alibi can be made.\"Just eating ramen, what did you expect?\"Official Site HereMore Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " むつみ屋 東京ラーメンストリーI always love a hot bowl of miso ramen on a cold day.  And it just so happened that there was a miso joint at the Tokyo Ramen Street.  And it just so happened that we wanted to make another movie of us (us being Daniel of howtojaponese.com and I) eating ramen.  And it just so happened that I'm on spring break and have every day free.  Let's go!If it weren't for modern shipping technology, you'd have to travel all the way to Sapporo, then 100km north into middle of nowhere to sample this stuff.  Mutsumiya actually ships the soup, flash frozen, to it's branches around Japan.All of their bowls have a kotteri rating of 4 or 5.  To put it in perspective, a rating of 1 might be water, while 5 would be used motor oil.  Miso from Sapporo has a tendency to be pretty good about 90% of the time, but that 10% is just horrid.  Let's hope this one is good.  Well, you are pretty much guaranteed a decent lunch at Tokyo Ramen Street.I went with the fuwatoro miso ramen.  Some sort of play on words, as fuwa-fuwa means light and fluffy.  The idea is that it's got scrambled egg poured into the broth.  It's only available through March.Fuwa-fuwa indeed.  Can I say fuwa-uma?  Delicious and fluffy?  Japanese onomatopoeia is expansive.The egg adds a unique touch to a standard bowl of Sapporo style miso soup.  But standard is not a problem.  Remember I said that 90% of miso bowls from up north are good?  Well this is no exception.The left over soup and egg drop combination is good to the end.And the run of the mill white miso ramen is good too.I use a lot of boring adjectives, like \"good\", because to be honest, I'm way more down with the crazy experimental miso ramen that is coming out of Tokyo.  Check out Gogyo in Roppongi for something that's exciting.Unless you want to try what beautiful Hokkaido has to offer.  In that case this'll do.Here's our video!More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " ひるがお 東京ラーメンストリー    The next stop on the Tokyo Ramen Street adventure took Daniel (howtojaponese.com) and I to Hirugao.  This is part of the Setagaya group of ramen shops, which I actually know very little about.  I know the recent \"meh\" bowl at Zero was a Setagaya production.  And I know that second to Ippudo in New York is a Setagaya place.  They know it too, since the description of this shop in Tokyo Station is \"The place made by the guys who were in some New York magazine's best of list\".    Regardless of relative fame, our goal to make video reviews of all the shops on Tokyo Station's Ramen Street must go on.    This time is all about shio, salt.    Shio ramen is often muted in taste.  I could easily say that it was my least sought after style, until I had the stellar bowls at Ivan and Ganko.  Now I'll give it a shot.  So let's give it a shot.    A simple bowl.    I don't want to give a strike two against the Setagaya group, but this bowl was just normal.  Delicious, of course, but normal.    I like the addition of a single, translucent shrimp atop the egg.  If one tasty shrimp had been a mound of tasty shrimp, I might upgrade my opinion.    Don't get me wrong though, this bowl was good.  Being Tokyo Station, it's good to keep your options open.  If you're about to catch the 5 hour bullet train to Hiroshima, a bowl at Rokurinsha would be good to, well, put you into a food coma sleep.  But if you are running late for an important business meeting, a light bowl at Hirugao is the way to go.  Here's the video!    More Shop Info Here   View Larger Map         ",

I finally made it to Menya Kissou!Took me long enough!  This is the #1 ranked shop on the supleks ramen database, which I link to at the bottom of every post.  But Japanese ranking systems are often skewed, and the domino effect is in full force.  A shop gets on TV, the next day the line is around the block, then the ranking goes up, regardless of actual quality.  But the English ramen blogging world, albeit is reserved for half a dozen people, might have insight that I actually listen to.Keizo of goramen loved it!Exile Kiss agreed with the #1 ranking.Ramen Otaku is down.Ramen Tokyo liked it but thought it was over rated.Rameniac was in the Ramen Tokyo boat.Regardless of the positives and the negatives, I at least had to go once.The menu is simple.  Ramen or tsukemen.  Big or small.  Normal toppings (egg, nori, menma, and pork).  You can get an overpriced beer if you want.45 minutes later, I was sitting inside, camera ready.Everything about this bowl is fantastic.  Everything.  The soup is a thick combination of pork and fish, but not too thick.  The noodles are handmade.  The pork melts.  The egg is perfect.Look at those.  Even though I had just eaten the champion noodles at Rokurinsha, these I have no problem with.Every review talks about how great the egg is.  It's like the common denominator in Kissou reviews.  I'll bow out of the discussion I guess, because almost every hanjitsu tamago I've had in the past month has been to my liking.  But on a simple thumbs up or thumbs down, you know which way it is.For someone like me, waiting in hour lines a few times a week is no problem.  I kind of enjoy it even.  But for a traveler to Tokyo who wants to do anything besides eat noodles in soup, I totally understand how this sort of thing could be a pain.  If I had to choose 1 shop with an insanely long lone (hour+), I'd recommend TETSU.  No second thought.An email from ramenadventure fan Dave led me to finally make the adventure out to this shop. Thanks for the bowl!  Dave is the 3rd or 4th person to email me out of the blue to hang out and eat ramen.  If' I've got the time (I usually do), let's slurp!More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

Forgive the lack of research, but when I go eat ramen with Ramenate!, I leave the scholarly stuff to him.Most of Tokyo burned down in the great Kanto earthquake of 1923, but luckily much of red-bricked Ginza survived.We went with the most old-timey drink we could think of, soba shochu in soba tea.The ramen was your standard original style.  This is ramen history here.  Even though I tend to be more interested in the new styles that are popular in Tokyo, it's nice to remember the roots now and then.Most chukasoba shops like this have other Chinese dishes on the menu.  Shredded, wok fried tofu is a standard.We got lots of smiles as we ran around the store taking photos of everything nostalgic that could be found.Ginza seems fairly sparse of ramen shops, leaning more towards high priced food for the high priced shopping that predominates the main road.  But hey, if you just spent your last 10,000 yen note on Louis Vuitton, maybe Manpuku is exactly what you need!More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " 六厘舎 東京ラーメンストリー    Underneath the bullet train, just minutes from the ticket gates, you can find some of the hottest ramen shops in Tokyo.    The aptly named Tokyo Ramen Street is a concept in efficiency.  Thousands of people come through busy Tokyo station every day.  Thousands of people want to eat good ramen.  And the best shops in town wouldn't mind more customers.  Is this a true win-win scenario?    Well, as long as you don't mind waiting an hour for your lunch.    Rokurinsha is the star of the Tokyo Ramen Street.  This might be the aftermath of last year's tsukemen boom.  Or it might just be that their noodles and soup are awesome.  On a warm March morning, on my spring break holiday, I joined Daniel from howtojaponese.com for the adventure.    Makes sense that you can pay with your train fare debit card.      There you go, the gold medalist of tsukemen in Tokyo.  The honor, though, is shared with TETSU.  I'd love to place those two bowl next to each other for a true test.  Either way, though, you're coming out a happy eater.    Thick, meaty soup.  It's cooked for over 13 hours, until all the ingredients are unrecognizable.  Pork, fish, vegetables, and secrets blend into liquid gold.    I fully recommend the original shop out in Osaki, but it's not convenient to anyone but those with time to spare and a good sense of direction.    This was the first shop in the Tokyo Ramen Street that we tried.  In the near future, we'll be checking out all of these shops, and then hopefully doing the same at some other ramen streets located in or very near stations.  There's one at Shinagawa station, and a new one at Koenji station.  Until then, enjoy another episode of Collaboramen!

You can read my account of the shop here.Today I was slurping it up with Jackson, the man behind the San Francisco ramen truck Shirohige.  He was in town, living like a true ramen nerd, eating bowl after bowl of the stuff.  From the reviews and information on the internet, Shirohige serves up a lot of simple shoyu.  I immediately knew that he should taste Nishio.These noodles are amazing.  Custom made with corn flour, they stay firm even when distraction should warrant soggy noodles.Another thing I love about Nishio is the owner.  He speaks so fast, and so slangy, that I only pick up about 40% of what he says.But what I picked up today...... is perfect.

I chose a shop that was high on my list, having been recommended by... ummm... I forgot.  I write down all recommendations I am lucky enough to be given, mark them on my Tokyo street atlas, and when the time comes, I slurp.I'm not sure if Tenho was in some top 10 list, or just word of mouth.I wasn't really into this one.  Not much impact for a tonkotsu shoyu soup.  The pork was a complete write off.  Maybe it would taste better after a few drinks from nearby Trick or Treat, a Halloween themed drinking hole.Excluding Gogyo, which is just enough outside of Roppongi to be... not Roppongi, I haven't found a good shop in this area.  The consensus is, though, that drunk foreigners don't really care what kind of ramen they eat.More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " 覆麺デスマッチ    Having thoroughly enjoyed Fukumen a few weeks ago, I decided to head back for their monthly special noodle experiment.  I say experiment because this is one of the strangest bowls I've had.  Served by some really strange dudes.  Let's get to it!    It's called... Deathmatch...  Fine, I'll play along.  In the white corner...    we have the challenger.    Fried oysters.  And in the black corner...    ... the reigning champion.    Sea turtle eggs.    I have to say, this was definitely a culinary first for me.  I'm assuming it was also a first for all the people who joined us today.  A veritable who's who of the food blogging world, we had ramen dream livin' GoRamen, first on the slurpin' scene Rameniac, cupcake lovin' Poptisserie, and new guy on the ramen scene Modern Day Deity.  But back to the sea turtle egg ramen.    Very interesting.    The fried oysters area  topping that I could go for again.  Heavy seafood goes great with a salty shio soup.  See Ayu or Kaijin for proof of this.    The sea turtle eggs were... interesting.  About the size of a ping pong ball, and almost as tough on the outside.  Inside was a rich yolk that exploded into my mouth on first bite.  The taste was good, but the weird factor might be too much for some people.  Don't worry though, this one day ramen is long gone by the time you read this.    Free toppings if you bring your member's card.    For those around during the upcoming Golden Week holidays, Fukumen will have a different ramen each day.  May 1st - Shrimp wonton shio ramen May 2nd - Curry ramen May 3rd - Squid ink ramen May 4th - Tantanmen May 5th - Cabbage roll tomato ramen  Enjoy!

        "post": " 創新麺庵 生粋Our adventure today started with a meeting of the usual suspects and an unnamed third who may be named in the future.  Hey Nate... on the facing page!  Inside jokes aside, we needed an Ikebukuro ramen shop, and we needed it stat!Soshinmenan Kissui translates to something like \"Original New Noodle Retreat Natural\".  There must be a better explanation.  But on the kanji heavy banner outside, my eyes instantly went to the roman letters.Sanma no shio-yaki.  Sanma is a type of fish, and it is good.  It's often grilled with salt, served alongside a glass of cold beer, and eaten in it's entirety.  If you come to Japan, order sanma at any Japanese bar that serves drinks and food.  What does it look like?Another piece of advice, don't leave fish on the doorstep of your shop, buy some plastic models like Kissui did.I went with the shop recommended shoyu.  Shoyu ramen made with a lot of fish is nothing new, so I was expecting something a bit on the normal side.What came was something amazing.Most ramen has a faint whiff of the sea, an undertone of fishy things.  But this was like nothing I've ever had.  It smelled like a roasted sanma.  Not just a little, a lot.As with many strong smells, the taste isn't so powerful.  It's light and refreshing.  And the noodles hold almost zero flavor from the soup.  Luckily the noodles are great.It should be noted that the egg is flavored with wine, but I didn't really taste it over the smell of sanma.I have a feeling I'll be back here.  Not often, but this is ramen that I might crave every once in a while.  Check it out for a totally different taste.More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

Unique, considering that ramen shops are usually 99.999% dudes.  This might be in part to the recent publication of a Girl's Ramen Club book and even more recent Girl's Ramen Club Magazine.A sleek interior and nice music... but how is the ramen?It's great!  The yuzu shoyu ramen has a rich chicken taste that might be a little normal, but is given my stamp of approval with the addition of fresh grated yuzu citrus.  I think they put juice in it as well, since the sweet lemony flavor is really strong.One problem though, it's a little on the small size.  This is cafe ramen, something you could slip into anytime for a light snack without having to worry about the after effects of consuming a massive amount of pork.By the way, the name comes from a mountain in neighboring Kanagawa prefecture.  Mt. Oyama, also known as Mt. Afuri, has a revered holy spring.  Ask any ramen chef if water matters, and you'll get a resounding affirmative response.More Shop info HereView Larger Map  ",

Keisuke the man is known as a classically trained master of French cuisine who brought that knowledge to ramen.  Keisuke the shop is a bit more complicated.  Each shop he opens is as far off from the last as it can be.  Here on the Ramen Street is a branch of his 2nd shop, featuring a shrimp heavy broth.    The original shop in Takadanobaba is hard to forget.  The ramen is served in a strange, egg-shaped bowl that looks like something out of a Scandinavian design museum.  How will this one compare?    Before setting into the noodles, I couldn't resist these shrimp gyoza.  Even though you only get 3, you should get some.    Next to the shrimp ramen is something new.  A Japanese spiny lobster ramen, made only for this shop.  Actually, the 4th Keisuke shop makes a spiny lobster soup, but serves it with a fried tsukemen.  I'm rambling... to the soup!    Much stronger than the shrimp, this soup is rich.  You can really taste the seafood, herbs, and vegetables.  Taking a sip is hard though...    ... from this massive spoon.  Seriously, it's large.      Despite having the shortest line, this is my favorite of the shops on the Tokyo Ramen Street.  It's a nice change from the usual.    Seriously, that spoon is large.

These lines always confuse me, since neither of them are taken from Ikebukuro or Shinjuku.   No worries, I had time to spare and could just walk a few kilometers.Are there a lot of ramen shops in Tokyo?  To put it in perspective, this little walk isn't near anything.  Residential.  Maybe a school or 2.  Here is every shop I passed.Linda man?This shop was on TV, which is usually enough of an incentive for me to go.Can you guess where I am?Not a ramen shop per se, but I think this family restaurant has ramen on the menu.Many different styles, you'll never suffer from lack of variety in Tokyo.Only about 30 minutes have passed on my little walk.  30 minutes, and enough ramen shops for days of new adventures.Almost to my destination station, the shops can be seen everywhere.Oops, I got distracted.This part of town is a bit far for me, so I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon.

I get random emails from blog readers who plan on a Tokyo visit, and I'm always happy to meet.  I wanted to take today's new friends, a couple of girls from Texas, to Fuunji.  But then...\"We want to drink in Golden Gai!\"I can't argue with that logic.  Golden Gai, the drinkinest street in Shinjuku, is also home to one of the best ramen shops in Town.  Nagi!A note of caution, this isn't delicious (it's an ashtray).  The ramen on the other hand...Wonderful!Rich!Perfection!Today I ordered a side of sansho pepper oil.  More than just spicy rayu, these are sometimes known as numbing pepper.I didn't get this in previous visits.I will get it in the future.Being Golden Gai, might as well have a drink with your noodles.Official Site Here (good design)View Larger Map  ",

Seabura, the chunks of fat that can make or break an adventure.How does it look?A few people had recommended this bowl to me, and now I'm sold.  Usually, seabura is silky smooth, but this one was a bit more substantial.  Just enough texture to know that you are eating something, but not enough to know that you are eating chunks of pork fat.The soup had a lot of onion in it, which left a sweet aftertaste.This is the hangover killer here.  For the residents of Hatagaya, out on a late night binge, the perfect tisane is infused with fat.Feel free to add extra tare if you want some more flavor.Though it doesn't really need it.Official SiteView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " 冬蔭激城麺Here it is, folks, the place with the $120 bowl of ramen.But it's actually a bit of an adventure just to get to that point.  Let me explain the process.First things first, you come to this shop in Kanda for a modestly priced bowl of Tom Yum ramen.  For 1500 yen, you get either spicy red, coconut creamy white, or black sesame infused black.  Have a seat at the stylish counter.If you want to continue along this road, call and make a reservation to have a bowl of the 3000 yen Spicy Castle ramen.You'll get to sit in the red chairs, out of sight from the lowly peons.The last step is to make a reservation, at least 3 days in advance, to the shop in Nakameguro.  This is where you eat the Emperor ramen.  Yeah, the 10,000 yen bowl of ramen.  I'll rant about this in due time.Let's focus on the regular bowl.It's not your typical bowl of ramen.  This is Thai fusion.Let's get the price thing out of the way first.  1500 yen is very high for ramen.  But many Thai restaurants in Tokyo will charge almost that much for a bowl of tom yum soup, so I don't think it's too much of a stretch.It's really good by the way.  You can tell that everything in this bowl is high quality.  The spice resonates on your tongue.The fired egg is an interesting choice.The chef give explicit instructions, \"Put exactly 5 spoonfuls of soup into the rice.\"So, the question is, will I go for the 10,000 yen ramen?Probably.... ...if the opportunity presents itself.  Maybe I find a 10,000 note blowing down the street one day.  Maybe another reporter is in town writing the umpteenth article about this shop and he needs a tour guide.  Maybe one of my dear readers treats me!Regardless, I'll let you know.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " もちもちの木I needed a shop in this specific area, or my new adventure would be explaining to my student why I was late to our English lesson.  Luckily, the main road in Shinjuku Nishiguchi is a hot spot for ramen shops.Mochi Mochi no Ki had moved literally 1 block away, but that still warrants fresh bouquets of \"welcome\" flowers.  It's a Japanese custom to give these flowers to any new shop in the area.  What's not Japanese culture, though, is the guy we spotted stealing a handful of lillies!Seriously, he took about 5.  Anyways, down to the basement for this new ramen shop.The interior of Mochi Mochi no Ki is very nice.  Everything is wood.  Classy.  There is even a roped off section that looks like it used to be a VIP lounge.  Who knows what was going on here a week ago.More on the pizza later.Very hot (due to the layer of scalding oil on top), very fishy (due to numerous fish that went into the soup), and very, very good.The menma is their own creation, and you can buy packs of it to take home.  If I ever try and make my own ramen, I know where to go for at least one of the toppings.And, yes, the ramen pizza.  It was only 400 yen due to the opening celebration.  Would I order it every time?  Probably not.  I'd rather eat 400 yen worth of that menma.  So good!More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

I put the word out, and on Monday, June 21st, about a dozen ramen loving friends met up to try a few dozen bowls.The shoyu from Nagao was fishy and simple.The thick broth at Naoji was great, but that massive piece of pork was a big let down.  A proper grill could have done the job, the blowtorch left it practically raw.Everyone who tried the miso from DoMiSo was disappointed.TETSU was good, but nothing like the original shop.Shichisai was decent.Even though the ramen wasn't as great as visiting one of the main shops, it's a good place to sit and have a few beers from the convenience store.Thanks for coming out everyone!

        "post": " Readers of ramenadvnetures.com have sent me a lot of email.  We've met up in Tokyo, talked about the state of ramen affairs, drank, and had a few adventures.  Recently, though, I got a unique request.  A request for some ramen related books!  It goes without saying that in Japan there would be a couple pieces of ramen literature to choose from.  Guidebooks, recipe books, and even ramen trivia books are available anywhere books are sold.  Here's a few, both from my collection and from the ones I bought for my new ramen friend.   ラーメンバンク    ラーメンバンク (Ramen Bank) is a monthly free publication.  You can pick it up at select ramen shops. Each issue focuses on a certain area in Tokyo, with reviews and interviews.  It's a bit sparse, but since it doesn't cost you anything, who can complain!     東京圏のご当地ラーメン    東京圏のご当地ラーメン (Local Shops in the Tokyo Area) not only explains all the different local styles of ramen around Japan, but it gives you spots the Tokyo area where you can try those bowls.  Ever wonder what Kobe ramen is like?     女子ラーメン部   女子ラーメン部 (Girl's Ramen Club) is aimed at the ladies, with shops featuring healthy fare and posh interiors.  I like this book, it's the most artistic of the lot.  And trust me, taking a girl to somewhere like Ikaruga is a much better date than Jiro.  Field tested!     ラーメンWalker    The Walker series of magazines is very extensive.  There is a Walker for everything and everyplace.  Tokyo Walker, Museum Walker, Highway Rest Are Walker (I'm not making this up).  The idea is simple.  Pick up this info rich mag and start walking!  Above is the Fukuoka version.  Yes, each city not only has a general Walker (cafes, nightlife, sightseeing, etc.) but some cities have their own ramen specific versions.    Of course Tokyo has one.  Info on 363 shops it says.  Ramen Walker is so packed with info, that it's a bit of an overload.  But when you are in a strange part of town, just whip it out (or pop into a local convenience store to borrow a copy) and you're bound to find something good nearby.    噂のラーメン    噂のラーメン (Ramen Rumors 2010) Another info rich annual book.  A bit of information about trends and new shops and rumors.  Will curry ramen or salt ramen be the next big boom?    佐野実のラーメン革命    佐野実のラーメン革命 (Sano's True Ramen Revolution) is a book from the \"ramen nazi\" himself, showcasing some of his favorites.  If you get the approval of this guy, you and your shop are set for life.  Just ask the 5 chefs who are featured.  Don't let the grimaces deter you, this is some of the best stuff around.    And anyone who has a 2 page spread for Junk Garage is OK with me!    ラーメンが好きつ！    ラーメンが好きつ！(I love ramen!) is a quiz book I found today.  Q:  Where is spicy tsukemen from? A: Hiroshima.  This book is pretty interesting, and it has some info about shops as well.    無化調ラーメンMAP    無化調ラーメンMAP (Additive Free Ramen Map)  is part of the MAP series of books.  This one features preservative free ramen.  Great if you don't want any MSG, which is a common ingredient in ramen here in Japan.   There is another one in the series that shows off nostalgic ramen shops, and a few for the prefectures that neighbor Tokyo (Saitama, Kanagawa, and Chiba).    Cookbooks    These are more instructional manuals.  The one on the left has some interesting interviews with top guys in the industry.    The one on the right has great step by step instructions (lots of color photos) for making the stuff.  If you were to read this book cover to cover (Japanese ability a plus), you could jump right into the world of ramen and start making it yourself.  I like that they really go into depth, not with a generic recipe, but with recipes from popular shops.    Searching for \"ラーメン\" on the Japanese Amazon site yields thousands of results, by the way.         ",

        "post": " 四川担担麺 阿吽TBS, the major television network in Japan, hit gold with last year's Big Tsukemen Festival.  The concept is simple.  Invite a bunch of popular shops, advertise it using your own network, and take half the pot.They've had a few more events since the one in Hibiya about 6 months ago.  One in Roppongi, and even a smaller one in Fukuoka are the two I'm aware of.    Today's adventure took me to a very Western feeling part of town, Akasaka.  It's also the home of the TBS headquarters.On a drizzly June weekday, there weren't too many people.This time, you have 9 shops to choose from.  The spicy tantanmen from Aun looked good.The signature \"Fire\" tantanmen came spiced up big time.  Spicy soup, some sort of added brown mystery powder, and lots and lots of chili oil.My friends went with Tanakaand uber-famous Taishoken.I have to say, I picked the right one.  Not saying the others weren't bad, but this spice was perfect.Please take pictures and upload to twitter or your blog!Ok!I think these outdoor ramen festivals are great.  Unlike many shops, lingering around, drinking convenience store beers, and trying multiple bowls is greatly encouraged.  In fact, let's do just that.Date:  Monday, June 21stTime: 7:00pmPlace:  This thing in the middle of the Akasaka Sakasu square.If you are in Tokyo, let's meet up and have a bowl or two.Here's a video about the festival.  I couldn't get past a minute of the music though.  See you on the 21st!View Larger Map  ",

        "post": " ココスThere are a few chains of family restaurants in Japan.  A family restaurant is akin to a diner in America.  Like Denny's (which happens to be here too).  Skylark, Denny's, Joyfull, Cocos, Gusto, Royal Host, the list goes on and on.  These are everywhere, especially out in the more rural parts of town.  You can expect a decent meal for about 1000 yen, a self service drink bar, and yes, ramen on the menu.Also come expecting lots of specials and seasonal fare.  It's summer, so a cold tantanmen made with soy milk is perfect to cool down your body, while the addition of some spicy rayu makes you sweat.  Nature's AC!Anyways, it's just so so.  The soup was nice, the noodles mediocre, and that pile of meat inedible.Don't forget the drink bar!  Cocos is my favorite of the lot, they have tea you can brew yourself, and lots of coffee drinks.  I suggest a hot cocoa, an espresso, and some steamed milk.  Then mix it up!Happy summer (I promise to eat some real ramen again soon).  ",

        "post": " 菊や        I was feeling antsy, with nothing to do on a Sunday afternoon.  It was on the cool side, a perfect day for a little motorcycle ride and some ramen.  But getting to Kikuya is hardly the adventure.        So far, looks fairly normal.  But if you search for \"ice cream ramen\", this is the spot you will be sent to.  THAT'S the adventure.        Before we get to the main attraction, you should know that they have a plethora of strange ramen on the menu at Kikuya.  Purple, blue, and green are achieved with different vegetables added to the broth.  I was tempted to try the purple.  But the friendly owner pushed the ice cream on me.        A bowl of cold shoyu ramen toped with an ice cream cone.        Did you expect something else?        Eating it was a bit challenging.    Oh, the taste?  Yeah, it wasn't so good.  It wasn't bad, just not so good.  Actually, the flavor was nice, but the whole thing being cold didn't sit right.  Maybe if the ramen was piping hot, and the ice cream cold, I would have been able to finish it.  But I couldn't.  Mottainai!        Looking at the menu on the wall, I saw a new word.  アルカリ (arukari).  Inquiring minds want to know.        Of course... batteries.    The story behind the weird, experimental bowls is a fun one.  This shop is over 48 years old.  About 10 years ago, a local elementary schooler on his way home stopped in.  It was hot, so he asked the owner if he could have some ice cream.  Then, imagination at work, he asked if he could put that cone into his ramen.  Why not?  But instead of a one off joke, the chef put it up on the wall as a new menu item.    Kids are always looking to get the last laugh, so they started ordering more unusual bowls.  Hot chocolate ramen.  No problem.  Soy milk and coffee ramen.  Done.  Green tea.  Check.  And finally, from a particularly cheeky young lad, \"Can you throw some batteries in my bowl?\"    Enjoy.    More Shop Info Here    View Larger Map    I was kindly asked to be part of the July blog matsuri.  Ice cream ramen is certainly an east meets west idea, but I gotta say that Ivan's taco-style-ramen was the best example of this concept.  Bring it back Ivan!             ",

I was out in Ebina that other day, and passed Machida on the hour long train ride.  Isn't ramen loving Yo! Japan's favorite shop there?  A quick text message and reply later, and I knew where my adventure for the night would be.Sapporo style miso is the deal here, and if you get the Oyaji set, you'll get just that with a side of gyoza.Ok, so this miso is really really good.  The general consensus with miso is that it needs to have a huge first impact the second you taste that soup.  Oyaji delivers.  Using imported dutch lard and a variety of vegetable, it tastes a bit like buttered corn dipped in pork broth.The noodles, pork, and toppings are simple, letting the soup stand out.The gyoza were fine, but it was a bit too much food for me.  If you went with a friend, maybe one of you could get the set.  Good luck getting a friend to go to Machida, though, it's a bit of a trek, out on the border of countryside Tokyo and Kanagawa.Along with Kururi and Tsujida, this is definitely a place to get your miso fix.More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " ローメン???I stumbled on this new restaurant in Nagano city a few month ago when I was up visiting a friend.  We were refused at the door, and since then my friend was turned away another 2 times.  This place is popular!  It's a place that serves nothing but Shinshu sake and food (信州 is the old name for the area around Nagano, 200km North of Tokyo).  I had to come back.Little did I know that this would become another ramen adventure.  Or should I say romen.Romen was created in 1955, in a countryside town.  It's made with mutton, and more like a soupy yakisoba than a ramen.  My friend begged me to to get it.  Why?It's pretty stinky.  Definitely not something I would eat often.  But it goes great with sake.Copious amounts of Japanese liquor can lead to ordering some other local delicacies.The left is grasshopper.  The middle bee larvae.  The right some sort of river bug.  New ramen topping?Local honey poured on local ice cream.This place was amazing.  There was plenty of normal type food too.  Lots of river fish and mountain vegetables.  And sake.Lucky people of Nagano, you are lucky!You should go to this event.  Ramen Fantasia is in the Tokyu building, on the top floor.  About a dozen experimental collaborations are being created.I can't make it, but a collaboration between Junk Garage and Mr. Bond of Hearts!  Is that a whole clove of roasted garlic?  Someone go and let me know!  ",

        "post": " インフィニThis shop is what dreams are made of.  At least one man's dream that is.  Mr. Mita had one taste of the mazemen at Junk Garage, and fell in love.  Everything that I felt, so did he.  Big difference though.  While I'm content to adventure around eating the stuff, he wanted to make it.  And that's how Infinitus came about.  At least as far as I can decipher from our short conversation and poking around their website.Another thing to note, is that this is a shop run by, and built for, soccer fans.  Everything is soccer.From the menu.  The toppings menu is actually the \"trappings\" menu.To the decor.  There's that guy.  Sorry, I know absolutely zero on the subject of soccer.Ramen on the other hand...The special mazemen is covered in tasty things.  Spicy mayo, garlic chips, raw egg, bonito flakes, and a massive pile of grated cheese (hidden from view by the noodles).Then there is the tare, which is made with beef bones instead of the usual pork or chicken.  This lends a sweeter taste.  The overall bowl was a bit lighter than the one at Junk Garage, though you can deck it out with as many toppings as you want.Very good, a must for anyone who likes the junk style.  The visual impact alone is worth the trip.  I'll be back soon to try their signature dish, some sort of spicy vegetable ramen.Icing on the cake, a stranger who was done riding trains for the day gave me his 1 day pass.  That saved me over 500 yen for the rest of the day's travels.  Awesome!Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

We didn't have many ideas, but we were only a couple stops away from Shibuya and it's ramen packed South side streets.Our original choice of noodles for the day was a fatty, soupless ordeal, so we went with that theme for plan B.  Abura soba is heavy on the oil, and light on the liquid.Follow the instructions.  A couple turns from each squeeze bottle, mix it up, enjoy.This is a more traditional style, not that I'm any expert on abura soba.  This was maybe the second time I've ever had it.  It's for sure something you should try if you have a chance.  There are probably some better shops out there, but this one, centrally located in Shibuya, is a safe bet.It should look something like this.Then something like this.That's right, oft mentioned Nate of Ramenate.com is gone.  Back to the States for school.  Nope, he wasn't here on a ramen research grant, but something about post modern Japanese literature.  Which means he'll be back.  Until that day, good luck to you and your backlog of 400 ramen shops to write about.

With the recent departure of Daniel, and the upcoming departure of Nate, I'm in need of new ramen friends!It's ramen time!The soup here is a thick chicken broth, very potage like.  Very excellent.  Very chicken-y.  2 kinds of chicken meat and an egg.  I often have a problem with too much chicken oil, but it was fine here.The spicy bowl adds just a little kick, nothing major.  Flip a coin, you'll be fine with either.\"May the slurp be with you\"It took my 5 minutes to think of that.  I'm not happy with myself.  Give me a minute...\"You are part of the ramen alliance, and a noodler!\"You do better!  Moving on...A cold summer bowl looks appealing.  Umeboshi and fresh shiso leaf.

A large portion of that group tends to be as a result of late night drinking in Golden Gai, Shinjuku's shady yet colorful drinking district.  Months ago he met an ancient ramen master, and we'd been itching to get to this shop since.  Goramen was along for the adventure as well.In their inebriated states, Nate and the master spoke about how he takes random trips across the globe in the name of research.  A few weeks in Cambodia to check out the local peppers?  Sure, why not.The won ton ramen looked perfect.  Some of the biggest I've had in Tokyo.  Everything is solid at Koya.  Not just the food, but the vibe as well.The atmosphere is great.  This shop is massive, with seats for up to 80 people.  It's also staffed by half a dozen elderly ramen veterans.  The waitress, somewhere in her late 60s, warned Nate about his bowl in the best English she could muster.\"Very hot\"Sure enough, those mysterious spices from far away lands were abundant in the spicy ramen.  We speculated some sort of habanero.By the way, there is a more complicated dinner menu.  I'll be back to try some of the more unique creations.  And stay tuned to Ramenate for a more detailed, properly researched writeup... someday!More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

Even though Izu is only about 3 hours from Tokyo, you wouldn't know it with the blue skies and white sand beaches.  Another difference is the lack of ramen, especially at the hotel up in the mountains where I was living for my time there.So on the way home, a few fellow camp counselors and I adventured to nearby Yumegahama beach for some Ise Ebi ramen.  Ise Ebi is also known as Japanese spiny lobster.This was recommended in my motorcycle touring book, which almost always steers me to some great food.Sure does look good!But, like the last time I ate Ise Ebi ramen in Izu, it was just so so.  The one compliment I can make is that the simple miso was buttery and went well with the lobster.This time made me realize that I don't really like Ise Ebi all that much.  The amount of meat you get in one go is about as much as a couple tiger prawns.  How does the old saying go?  Fool me once, shame on you?  A fool and his money are soon parted?  Anyways, 1500 yen is what it will cost you.5 hours of motorcycle touring later....More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " アイバンラーメンPlusAt 11:30am on Thursday the 23rd of September, Ivan opened his second shop.  Although I had sampled it a week prior, I had the most untraditional item on the menu, the cheese mazemen.  It was time for the true test.It's time for Ivan's special ramen.Sold out?!?  Just kidding.  Not sure what this option was for, maybe future seasonal dishes.  I went with the ramen.  So did my ramen posse for the day.  Two ramen fans visiting from the States, my new Japanese friend, and Keizo.  5 bowls of ramen (and an extra mazemen for Keizo).The shop is full of new equipment.  Roast, broil, steam... but does it help make good ramen?Yes!This bowl is very unique.  At his original shop, Ivan strays from tradition and uses almost no pork in the soup (the chicken bones are roasted in some pork fat if I remember correctly).  At Ivan plus, he takes it even further, omitting the chicken as well.  This is strictly a fish and vegetable stock.  If you've ever had a bowl of udon noodles, you know the taste.But knowing Ivan, he took it a step further, with a bit of the west thrown in for good measure.  At first, I couldn't place it.  Then a little voice in my head told me.  Or maybe it was Keizo.  Anyways, there's a hint of cheese.  Ivan confirmed this, and actually there is cheese in almost every menu item.Ramen without pork, with an essence of cheese?  Is it ramen?  In the traditional sense of the word, not really.  But thats what trends are for!  A recent trend in the Tokyo ramen world has been cafe-style ramen shops.  Light soups, stylish interiors, healthy options.  See the oft mentioned Girl's Ramen Club magazine for a long list of cafe-style ramen shops.A traditionalist, who longs for the nostalgic days of a tiny old shop serving shoyu ramen, might not be pleased with all this new stuff.  But for me, I wouldn't have it any other way.Ivan's Site HereView Larger Map  ",

Despite being aimed at the opposite sex, Girl's Ramen Club never fails to disappoint.  The maps are easy to read, the photos beautiful, and the choice of ramen is impressive.Do re mi fa so la ti do!  Do Miso is located just at the end of Ginza's fashionable main shopping street.  You can easily find a watch or necklace costing more than 10,000 bowls of ramen.  Maybe that's your thing.  My thing is the later.Do Miso sounded familiar, but I couldn't place it.  As soon as I saw the towel hanging in back, I remembered.  They were one of the participants in a recent ramen festival.  Actually, it wasn't so good at the event, and most bowls went unfinished.  The problem was the spice.  It was just too much for the average person.  Fear not, you can choose your level, from regular to fire.  I played it safe, with the futsu, regular, spicy miso ramen.Good choice!  It was very hot none the less.  If you don't love spice, avoid this one.My student went with the regular miso ramen.  He said it was one of the best bowls of miso he'd ever had.All in all a great bowl.  Kikanbou in nearby Kanda rates a little higher for me on the spicy miso chart, but maybe this is a close second.This ramen would be excellent with a beer or two, but for a couple of guys on our lunch break, that's not an option.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " アイバンラーメン+I had a chance to preview the new Ivan Ramen today.  Ivan Plus.  The adventure turned out to be the train there.  The Odakyu line from Shinuku station comes in 5 or 6 flavors, ranging from a slow local train to the infamous Hakone Romance Car.   Most, but not all of the trains stop at Kyodo.  Learn from my mistake, and don't take the orange super commuter express line.  Take the red express.After visiting the rice fields of far west Tokyo, I hopped a train in the reverse direction, and made it to the new shop.  The design is great, very comfortable, with lots of speakers playing loud music.  Ivan even put a speaker in the noodle room, so whoever has the task of cranking out the day's noodles can avoid insanity.The menu is totally different from the other Ivan shop.  The ramen uses more fish in the recipe, as opposed to the chicken heavy soup at his other shop.The onsen tamago rice bowl went great with this special soy sauce.Recently, Ivan was on television for some sort of \"reduce the salt\" challenge.  Part of the show involved a tour of a shoyu factory out in Chiba.  This is the XO of soy sauce.  It's great.The current menu is only ramen, tsukemen, and mazemen.  Each is a completely different thing.  I went with the cheese mazemen.Simple, delicious, and deadly to anyone with a lactose intolerance.With no soup, it's a much more Italian tasting bowl.  In the future, I'd order it with an egg topping for a sort of ramen X carbonara thing.The noodles are different here as well.  Wide and flat.  They might be getting wider in the future.  It's still a week before the official opening, anything could happen.Speaking of the opening.  I'll be there, on the 23rd, at 11am with some friends if anyone wants to come along.  It might be extremely crowded, since it's a holiday and Ivan is pretty famous in Tokyo.  The cheese mazemen was an impulse order.  I've got to try the regular ramen.See you next week!  11am outside the Kyodo station gates.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

One of the side effects of this is countless man-made lakes.

It's just one of the many natural attractions you can see on the Kurobe Tateyama Alpine Route.Leave it to the management at the Kurobe dam restaurant to create a special ramen that matches the water.The green noodles are almost inedible.  Who knows where they come from, I'm 99% sure they don't make them on site.The green soup is actually alright though.  It's colored and flavored with spinach, and has a nice leafy flavor.The pork was horrible.There is also a fried egg on top, which was fine.

        "post": " The plan was to hike the length of the Northern Alps of Japan, camping on mountain peaks, cooking ramen, and enjoying the scenery.Taking things a step more adventurous, I packed enough nama ramen for 4 days, and enough instant noodles for 3.  Nama, meaning raw, means that I would need to actually boil the noodles, strain them, then add them to the soup.  It's not a difficult process, as anyone who has ever made spaghetti could tell you, but when backpacking it can be a bit of a challenge.  Instant noodles are simple, just boil some water, add the noodles and soup, and let sit for a few minutes.Made with some of the best water in Japan, straight from the mountains of the Tateyama range.These noodles are far superior to the dry kind.Success!Now the bad part.  The weather.  There were clouds and rain on all the peaks, with visibility of only a dozen or so meters at times, and typhoon level winds.  So I decided to head down into the valleys, and eventually ended my trip after 4 days instead of 8.I learned a few things about ramen.  If you're camping, go ahead and do the nama thing.  But if you are packing it, carrying everything on your back, stick to lightweight, easy to make instant stuff.  I bought all my ramen from the basement of Tokyo station, where there is a gift shop selling about 100 types of nama and instant ramen from around Japan.Oh, and if you are calling me out, saying that all it takes is a little wind and rain to send me crying home, I made a video of conditions on the peaks.

I used to visit the Shibuya branch once a week after an English lesson for a bowl and a beer.  There was a very cool vibe, almost like a ramen izakaya.  At some point, I stopped my Shibuya lesson, and the Nagi visits became less frequent.  Ever since, I've been searching for a great ramen shop that can also serve as a hangout.  The Cheers of ramen if you will.        The latest is Nagi Nicai.  Written in the Roman alphabet, I though nicai was some foreign, maybe Italian word.  But no, it's Japanese.  二階 literally means 2nd floor.  And this shop is on the 2nd floor.  Above another Nagi.  One step (floor) at a time.        The concept is a cozy bar with ramen and small dishes that encourage drinking.  The menu has a ton of options.        There are a few ramen choices, and the yaki-ramen looked good, but the staff recommended the signature shellfish ramen.        Yeah, that's something different.        Full of clams and mussels, this is, as advertised, great with drinking.  If it looks delicious, thats because it is.  Extremely.    This ramen is a bit like the steamed mussels occasionally eaten at overpriced Belgian beer bars in Tokyo.  Only it's half the price for double the shellfish.  And there are noodles.        Speaking of 2nd floors, the shop has a lofted platform with seating for about 6.        Just yell your order over the railing.        The atmosphere lends itself to relaxing and chatting with new friends.  Mr. S-Tani, sitting next to me, was introduced to me as another ramen geek.  His iPad makes a convincing argument:        He's been blogging his noodles for the last 5 years.  Check it out here.        My evening adventure included a first meet with a fan of the site, a temporary resident of Tokyo, whose Japanese at 1 month is better than mine was at 2 years.          We tried a couple of the small dishes.  The Beef flank baked in demiglass sauce and the lasagna.          I often recommend the Nagi in Golden Gai as a must for foreign visitors.  The vibe is great, and of course the ramen is excellent.  Along with Bassanova and Gogyo, these are the shops that can turn a mere mortal into a lifetime ramen lover.  I feel like adding naginicai* to that list, with an asterisks.    *It might be an injustice if I only recommend ramen that pushes the envelope, so please check out some more traditional shops in Tokyo.

        "post": " 魁 肉盛りつけ麺 六代目けいすけAnother lunch lesson and another ramen adventure.  My student gave me a range of stations, and Ueno happened to be within that area.  And a new Keisuke shop had recently opened in that area.  It was a no brainer!I'm a huge fan of this Keisuke character.  Speaking of characters.If you've followed this site for a while, you know the deal.  But if you are a recent visitor (thank you CNN!), I'll update.  Keisuke is a classically trained French chef.  But his love for Japanese ramen motivated him to open a great little miso shop.  After a huge success, the next shop opened.  But instead of another branch serving the same great ramen, the soup at Keisuke Nidaime was a completely different shrimp stock.  This was followed by a lobster tsukemen shop and a very strong meat and shoyu style.  October brings us his 6th.Flat fettuccine style noodles topped with stir fried pork.  The instructional comic recommends eating some as is.  It has a Chinese taste, I think they use a bit of ginger in the sweet sauce.The soup is very vinegary.  Very Chinese.I skipped the mayonnaise step and went straight to the curry powder.Don't forget to add some owari soup to the strong broth at the end.One bowl, 5 tastes.  I noticed you could get cheese as a topping.  Even though I didn't have that, I think it would be in your best interest to go for it.This shop is very near the exit of the Skyliner, the express train from Narita airport into Tokyo.  So, travelers, why not make this your first stop?  You could also walk another couple minutes to the excellent Daiki, for a more traditional style bowl.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

I didn't have any big ramen adventures planned for one lazy Friday afternoon, and since I teach near there, I decided to check it off my list.You never really know with junk style.  The noodles were completely normal.But the soup was very junk.  It tasted like melted butter, probably because of the saucer of melted butter that they dumped in.  Other than that, expect tons of garlic.I can't recommend it, since I felt ill after eating.My original post for Rahmen YamenView Larger Map  ",

There is a great English bookstore in Takadanobaba that buys and sells used books, and I made my annual book adventure, with about 20 read books in hand.  After lugging that much weight around town, I needed to replenish.  Of course I would be eating ramen, and what better to replenish lost protein then a soup made with organic beef bones.Dogen hails from Tottori Prefecture, far out in the West of Japan.  I've traveled almost everywhere in this country, but I've never been to Tottori.  It's that far out in the middle of nowhere.  Someday.The shoyu is simple and beefy.  It tastes almost like a kicked up version of beef broth.  It won't win any shoyu ramen competitions, but if you want to try something a little different, check this one out.A classy bottle of water.That began life as a bottle of organic shochu alcohol.  You can have a glass for 300 yen if you want.  I wanted to, but I never drink before work.  And I had to work.Not only alcohol, but there is a whole table of local Tottori goods for sale.  I wonder if the spices are good in ramen.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

To the 7-11!There is always, at every convenience store in Japan, some sort of new ramen publication for sale.  The latest trend will be... beef ramen.  Seriously, they just pull these trends out of a hat, I think.  Using this great map in the back, we found the one nearest to us. Naoji is on the edge of Shinbashi Station, in a very busy businessman-rich part of town.  I think I was the only one not in a black suit in a 50m radius.  We both settled in for the special tsukemen with extra memna piled on top.I'd seen this shop's name before, and only after searching past entries to this site did I realize that Naoji was at one of the recent ramen festivals.  At the time, the giant slabs of pork weren't the best.  But in the shop they were just right.Those are my shoes.  Did I mention, this shop is standing only?  Well it is.Being 6'4\". the one size fits all counters were a bit on the short side.  Despite the inconvenience of that, it's a solid tsukemen here.  But there has to be a bit more of an appeal.150 yen highballs.  Now we're talking.  A cocktail doesn't come much cheaper.Unless you go for the all you can drink special.  30 minutes for 400 yen*.*This is actually at a nearby izakaya.  Naoji is strictly eat and get out.Looks like someone had a few too many and high-fived the poor maneki neko a little too hard.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

On Sunday, at my friend's wedding, we ate what could well be the best course meal I've had in Japan.  On Monday I ate river fish sushi at a roadside stand while riding my motorcycle.  After all that, I asked a Nagano native to take me to the best ramen in town.Oishiya often tops local best of lists, and though the place was empty, it looked like a winner from the start.A winner indeed.The soup and noodles here at Oishiya are best described as \"easy going\".  Very simple, very clean.  On the other hand, the chashu and menma were some of the most robust and flavorful I've had.  As close to perfect shoyu as I've had.I've been promised that on future trips to Nagano that I'll be introduced to all the top shops.  Looking forward to it!More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

I'm often armed with a few guidebooks, my Tokyo street atlas (filled with notes about where to eat), and whatever new noodle magazine is on the shelves.  It's a lot of paper.  An analog solution to a modern problem.Introducing my new GPS system, to be called the Ramen Radar from now on.  You see, buried in the menu system is an extensive database of ramen shops.  Simply choose to display whatever is close to you, and you'll be eating a great bowl in less than a few hundred meters.It even has detailed information about each shop in the database.  The closest was a Kumamoto style tonkotsu soup.  Great!Did I mention the problems I had with this unit the other day?  On the way to a remote ramen shop in West Tokyo, the battery died.  Turns out this portable unit isn't too portable.  The battery lasts from somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour.  Strike one.  Lesson learned.  Wire it up to the motorcycle in the near future.This time, we couldn't find the shop.  Satellites in space indicated that we were 0m from our goal.  Phoning the shop indicated that they closed over 2 years ago.  Turns out the ramen database is a little outdated.  Strike two.  Lesson leaned.  Update the Ramen Radar software.Luckily, my student knew of nearby spot.  Okayama style.  My first bowl in Japan was actually at an Okayama shop.  That bowl cost 190 yen.  It wasn't so great.  How about this one?Excellent.  Firm, straight noodles similar to nearby Onamachi Style, with a lot less fat.  The soup is a simple, sweet shoyu.If you'd like to take your adventure to the next step, pick up some Okayama travel literature on your way out.More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " ズームイン!! SUPERI've had some interesting ramen adventures in these past couple years.  The latest started with an email from a producer at Nihon TV's morning show, Zoom In!! Super.  It's a daily, nationwide news program with random segments thrown in the mix.  The Maru Q bit takes a topic, asks questions to strangers on the street, and consults with an expert.  Yesterday, the Maru Q piece was about how dirty your curtains get, and how to clean them.  This Thursday, December 2nd, the subject matter is foreigners and their love of ramen.They wanted me to be the expert in their show.  Jumping at the opportunity, I recommended about 10 shops that I often take foreign visitors to.  We ended up filming at 3 of those.  Nagi, Bassanova, and Fuunji.We filmed a lot of stuff.  Introducing the shop to the news reporter, eating, commenting, talking about the web site.A surprise, Nagi had on hand some of their new spice mix that was made for their Hong Kong shop, Butao.I mentioned before that I am really loving this taberayu boom that is happening now.  Well this was the best so far.  A mix of hot oil, numbing sancho spices, shrimp meat (I think), and peanuts.  We all had a taste, and though it might have been too spicy for some of the crew, Imanaka-san and I loved it.Next up was Bassanova.Keizo and I got interviewed side by side.  I really hope it makes the final cut.  It's been great to share so many things with my good friend.On camera, Japanese people eating food is a cliche.  Take a bite, ponder for a second, then give a deep, emotional response.  Follow it up with an insightful comment.  I tried my best!Another cliche of Japanese food shows is the closeup shot of the bowl, steam rising, spoon gently swirling the soup.And the noodles slowly being lifted.  I have never seen a food program where this was not the case.There's a better shot over at goramen.The next shop was Fuunji.  I think it's the best tsukemen in Tokyo, though sometimes I miss the hot stone over at TETSU.Same deal.  Intro the shop, eat in front of the camera, make comments.A piece of advice.  Some people say not to wear white after Labor Day, but I say don't wear white to a ramen shop.I used Japanese and English.  I'm curious how they will edit it.The show will air sometime between 7:00am and 8:00am on Thursday, December 2nd here in Japan on Nihon Terebi, which is channel 4 here in Tokyo.  I'll try to get my hands on a copy.  This sort of thing usually makes it onto youtube.  ",

And though they were without their wrestling masks this time, the ramen made up for it.        I didn't even read the entire menu item on the ticket machine.  As soon as I noticed 食べラー油 I pressed the button.  Taberayu is hot on the scene, literally.  If you can read the kanji characters, you'll see eat and rayu, hot chili oil.  Taberayu is a chunky, often crunchy, spice mix that you can dollop onto anything.  Ramen, gyoza, rice; I even spread it on ham and cheese sandwiches.        Fukumen's junk-style had a massive spoon-full of taberayu, pork bits, and potato chips.  Although tasty, the thin noodles were tough to eat.  They tend to clump together.  You can order it with or without soup.        Diluted with a little of the shops signature shoyu soup, it becomes more manageable.    I highly recommend this shop, but try their normal stuff first please.    My Original Post Here        ",

Always a skeptic about other's opinions, I was reassured that it was a good shop - when we saw the sign out front stating that they were closed - because the soup was sold out.  So we went to another nearby shop, as I didn't really have the time to venture to greener pastures.Tasted like a bland miso with squirts of Thai Sriracha sauce.  Not so good.  Save that sweet spice for your pho.More Shop Info HereView Larger Map  ",

A few hours in any direction on the fabulous (and expensive) expressways is all it takes.  Towards the end of November, I planned a nice outing to Northern Ibaraki, about 150km north of the city.        I on the Honda CB1000, and my friend on the Honda CB750.  Our shared obsessions go a bit beyond Japanese motorcycles though.  He has the most knowledge of Ibaraki's ramen shops out of anyone I know.  Well, he's the only one I know, but that doesn't really matter.  We planned the first outing of The Ramen Riders, an official group I just made up.  In the future, we'll be riding to ramen destinations near and far.  Stay tuned!        Official named Yu-chan ramen, I'll choose to call this shop Gyoza Power from now on.  The shop sponsors a bike race team, and the walls are covered with photos and props.  Like this spent tire.        The fare at Gyoza Power is shoyu, miso, or stamina.  Having ridden for a few hours, with a few more to go, stamina was something I could use plenty of.        Stamina ramen is a whole genre that I have ignored until now.  The soup and toppings contain different elixirs of stamina.  In this case heavy on the garlic and topped with a thick stir fry of pumpkin and liver.        I was pleased, to say the least.  The sweetness of the Japanese pumpkin, the umami of the liver, and the thick shoyu soup came together well.  I can't imagine many of my readers will be up in this part of Japan anytime soon.  But if you are, here's a winner.        The spicy miso should have been dubbed spicy garlic miso.  In a good way.        And, yes, the gyoza was heavy on garlic as well.        We sped off, satisfied, with plans of more shops and touring the following day.    If you live in Japan and ride a motorcycle, drop me a mail and I'll let you know about the next meeting of The Ramen Riders!    Official Site Here   View Larger Map           ",

Well, I was in the mood for miso, and had forgotten my usual stack of ramen literature, so it seemed like a good choice.Somehow I really enjoyed it this time around. Maybe it was the limited edition gyoza.Definitely on the more unusual side of collaborations. This actor, Sho Aikawa, looked familiar, bit it wasn't until I got home that I realized what a fan I am of his. You see, he's been in a number of Takahashi Miike movies, of which I've seen many.  Not for the faint of heart, these films deal with Yakuza and ultraviolence.  Memories of Rainy Dogs and Fudoh, and of course the Dead or Alive Trilogy.  But this mashup between performer and ramen shop is actually to promote one I haven't seen; Zebraman.Did I mention that Miike's movies are a bit strange?Either way, the gyoza was delicious.My Original Visit Here  ",

The purchase of a new TV meant a new a coaxial antennae cable.  That was trip #1.  Trip #2 was for long VGA and audio cables to attach my computer to the big screen.  The 3rd trip was for another audio cable, since I purchased the wrong one during trip #2.  But I wasn't done.Lucky for me, I didn't have to go out of my way, as my Friday student wanted a bowl.  The newest Menya Musashi just happens to be in Akihabara.Named after Musashi Miyamoto, each Musashi shop, much like each of the famous swordsman's battles, is different.  And, as said battles, each bowl is a little unconventional.Like a 1608 victory with a piece of kindling.Or his frequent use of his short sword as a thrown weapon.This shop features Ganryujima ramen, named after, what else, a famous Musashi battle.  In this battle, Musashi fought (and won) with a wooden oar.It's a deep, strong shoyu, topped with bean sprouts and garlic.  You can ask for it with a double or triple size stack, but I just went with normal.The shop is actually more famous for the tsukemen.After lunch, I took care of my shopping list: a coaxial splitter and an audio cable splitter.And when I got home, as expected, the cable was the wrong size.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

Going even further, its a pork x chicken x gyokai soup by day, and a pork x chicken x niboshi soup at night.  It was still technically lunch, as we arrived just before 3:30pm.        It looks like the noodles are cooked in the gyokai broth.  A nice touch.        This was a great bowl.  Tonkotsu gyokai at it's best.  I judge this type of ramen by the subtleties.  Harumichi had a nice creamy undertone.          Shuga approves.        Even the egg was top notch.        It's becoming difficult to pick a favorite shop in Shinjuku.

Unexpected.The shop blends a typical fish and pork broth with a vegetable puree.  The result is a thick, rich, and maybe even healthy bowl of ramen.Like I said, a big surprise.

The idea is to go to industrial complexes and take photos.  There's a lot of books, sites, and clubs who do this sort of thing on a regular basis.Anyways, my new giant-underground-water storage-flood prevention room fan friends and I were in the mood for ramen.  Every 7-11 in the country has a copy of the local Ramen Walker magazine, which we used to make our choice.  Being out in the far reaches of Saitama, our options were limited.  And most places in Saitama seem to be closed from around 3pm to 6pm.  Heikuro was the closest ramen shop that wasn't closed.Four styles, I went with the spicy tonkotsu.It was good.  Standard, with a spice level that was fine for me, but trouble on one of my friends.By the way, from 4pm until 6pm on weekdays, you can get unlimited kaedama (替玉).  So basically this is an all-you-can-eat ramen shop.The high school kids who came in at the same time took full advantage of this.  One of them was up to 800g of refills by the time I left.More Info HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " らー麺屋 バリバリジョニーMy adventure of the day was to Koiwa, a little station about 20 minutes east of more central Tokyo.  When I reached into my bag to get my atlas, with it's cataloged recommendations, I suddenly realized that it was at home.  Probably still open to the Koiwa page.  Lucky for me, the 7-11 has the new Ramen Walker in stock, and a plan B was no problem.Bari Bali was a good find.  The relaxed atmosphere is offset by the complexity of the ticket machine.  What to order?A Thai inspired green curry ramen?  With a level 5 spiciness?  The choice wasn't hard.Much like Bassanova, it starts with a green curry paste, then adds the main soup.  The soup is very different though.  More of a vegetable soup than anything else.Very refreshing.  I'd give it 2 stars of spice though. The chef greeted me in English, and it turns out that Johnny, as he is called, spent much of his youth in Los Angeles.  Fond memories of ramen in his childhood, he set off to recreate what he loved.No, the Thai ramen wasn't a memory of his past.  It was simple shio that he wanted to succeed at.  Could I eat another bowl?You bet!  It's different than your average shio.  Bari Bari nice!  Apparently the taste changes throughout the day, and a lunchtime bowl will be a lot weaker in taste.Besides some great noodles, this place is very relaxed.  Johnny takes liberties with the choice of music, and a big screen TV on the wall was blasting American hip hop.When you go, tell him I sent you!Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " 京鰹節つけ麺 愛宕I taught my weekday student a new word today.  Exhausted.  As in I think we have exhausted our resources for good ramen in the area where we have our lesson.  But my ramen magazine had one remaining shop buried in the back pages.  Atago was only a few minutes away.  Since it was buried in said back pages, I was a little skeptical.Until we found it.  This is one beautiful shop.  The all black interior is a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of Shimbashi.  The trip hop playing on the stereo is a welcome break from the usual J-Pop that many shops play.  The line was long enough to indicate popularity, but short enough so that we could get inside out of the cold.Everything about this place is great.Atago's main star is their katsuo from Kyoto.  The fish base for almost anything with a Japanese taste, katsuo is obviously an important part of many ramen recipes.  And many would argue that the cream of the crop comes from Kyoto.The supporting ingredient is the goma tamago, eggs from chickens raised on a sesame seed diet.Day or night, you'll be getting a taste of these two.  But during the daytime, a chicken soup base is used, while night brings in a pork base soup.  Since it was lunch, chicken was on the menu.Superb.  Like I said, everything about this shop is great.  The ramen was no exception.  The fishy flavors really pop.  And the egg is, as expected, great.  Apparently it's healthier as well.I recommend a nice dollop of spicy oil.After eating, you can stroll over to nearby Atago Shrine for some culture.View Larger MapMore Shop Info HereOfficial Site Here (English!)

        "post": " 麺や 七彩        My recent adventure to Kokaiya was a search for the perfect chashu.  Pork simmered in shoyu, mirin, and other sweet and savory ingredients until it is tender and rich.  I dubbed it excellent, but who would know that just a couple days later I would find one to top it?        Shichisai is an extremely hyped shop.  An appearance in every magazine, a flawless victory on a past ramen TV challenge, and a line out the door.        You can choose shoyu or shio.  I went with the shoyu.  How was it?  It was LEGEN... wait for it...        ...DARY!  Let me break it down, starting with the bits that were great, and moving up.    The shop boasts organic fare.  No MSG, no chemicals, just high quality ingredients.  There are a lot of shops doing this these days.  In fact, I'd say most of the best shops are preservative free.        Then there are the noodles.  Wide and curly, it was almost enough to make me order a kaedama (extra serving), which is almost never done at a shoyu shop.  Very unique.    Then there was the pork.  From the above picture of my bowl, you can see two kinds.  Shichisai serves up both sirloin and pork belly.  Both are possible the best chashu I've had in Tokyo.  That good.  Goramen, who has eaten more chashu than you or I combined, calls it the best he's ever had.        I made the mistake of not ordering the chashumen, which for 300 yen more comes covered in the shop's signature meat.  I did, though, order a chashu rice bowl which was not really what I wanted.  Get the chashumen.  Everyone else who walked in the door did.        Noodle ears?  You can take home some of the noodle ends for a mere 50 yen, which is a steal for fresh noodles of this quality.        On the way out, this sign caught my attention.  Shichisai will be debuting at the Tokyo Ramen Street in April.  Congrats!  Along with...  Junk Garage.  This is excellent news indeed.

But time was of the essence, as I was meeting one of my site followers with just enough time to eat and make my lesson.        I wasn't in that much of a rush.        So when we arrived at Mega Ganja, it was closed.  Finding this place was quite an adventure, though I think it would be a bit easier with the massive line that I'm sure is prevalent during business hours.  I quickly went to plan B.  Ganja.  Didn't you just say Ganja?  No, I said Mega Ganja.  I'll explain later, things are looking bad on the wristwatch.        Ganja had, as expected, a massive line.  They do things like the recently closed Rokurinsha.  Empty every seat, then bring in the next 11 people.  Only when they finish will the next batch of customers be allowed in.  It's a bit slower than normal, but an interesting way to run a shop.  We waited about a 45 minutes.        The tsukemen is good, it's your standard tonkotsu gyokai style.  A bit fishier than most, and not quite as thick.  Definitely well made.  I always say that there are too many of these types of shops, but up in countryside Saitama, this is probably the only shop for miles around.        Ganja has actually been around for a while, but recently has really blown up.  They took their success, evident with their inclusion at the Yokohama Raumen Museum, and opened a few other shops in Kawagoe.  The one I really want to see is called Mega Ganja, a junk style stop with mounds of pork fat piled on top of your cheese noodles.  You'll just have to wait!    Oh, I ate this bowl in record speed, ran to the station, caught an express train, ran to my lesson, and made it with 4 minutes to spare.  Nice!    Official Site Here   View Larger Map         ",

On an adventure to check out a possible new apartment in downtown Shinjuku, I managed to check this shop off.The shop is known for the chashu.  Everywhere you look is a reminder that they were on TV.  However, the yellowing magazine articles and dated look of the TV appearance make me question if they are as good as \"advertised\".I ordered the standard chashumen, ramen with extra pork, after the shop staff wandered over and tried in their best English to explain what ramen is to me.  This time they didn't ask me if I could use chopsticks.  It happens more than I'd like to admit!Quite nice.  Of course, the chashu is great.  You can order a double serving of meat, which I recommend doing.  Cover that bowl up.  As for the rest of the bowl, it's a basic shoyu.  Nothing amazing.  Warm and nourishing on a cold day.Lunch gets you a free bowl of pork rice, made with the left over bits of pork that weren't beautiful enough to go into the ramen.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " 江戸川ヌードル 悪代官Some ramen adventures are about finding an excellent bowl of noodles.  Some, on the other hand, are just about finding the most shocking, craziest thing you can think of.  I came across this picture in a recently published magazine.北アルプス盛 - Japan's Northern Alps Size.   That's a bowl of ramen, topped with a deep fried pork fillet, deep fried chicken pieces, an entire Bunashimeji mushroom, curry sauce, tartar sauce, extra garlic, and maybe an egg or two.  I'm here for the scoop, at the expense of my health.Scanning the menu, I didn't see it.  Alas, they have stopped serving what could be the most unhealthy ramen in Tokyo.Though the secret menu at the bottom is a nice touch.  I got the 20 yen salad, which was just some shredded cabbage.  Maybe the 20 yen rice topped with a 20 yen spicy egg would have been better.As for the ramen, I went with the special ぬーどる, noodle.  Not the Northern Alps...but maybe the Southern Alps.  This bowl still had the fried chicken, multiple pieces of chashu, tartar sauce, egg, and some thick thick pork soup.  And a piece of nori bigger than my face.Well, it was what it was.  I've never liked tartar sauce in any cuisine, and when it mixed into the soup the resulting mayo X tonkotsu was a bit much for me.  If you are a fan of Ramen Jiro, you might like this one more than I did.More Info HereView Larger Map  ",

As the overused phrase goes; No Impact, No Life. Or something like that.After a midday lesson, I raced my student here.  Him on the train, and me on the bicycle.  Arriving a few minutes early, I circled the block to find about 4 or 5 ramen shops with lines out the door.  Good sign... for the neighborhood.  Kai had no line.  Bad sign... for the shop.  But the fact that it's a bit of an adventure to find this shop (the door is a bit nondescript) might affect it's popularity.  Let's hope that's the case.At the first taste, this shop should have a line.  The shops original 3 miso blend is very dark and, when mixed with the fishy stock, makes for that desired impact.  The pile of onion gives a sweetness to the whole thing.  All in all, not the most amazing miso, but for someone who has to try them all, you won't regret it.On the way home I noticed this!

I was in no mood for Jiro-kei, especially not from a place that boasts the kanji for man - 男 - in the name.  Its not that I don't like it, but I was meeting out of town friends in a few hours, and the after effects of \"にんにくを入れる?\" are usually painful for those at the other end.  Yes, you can always tell if someone has had some from a Jiro style ramen shop by the garlic on their breath.        But what's this?  I pulled a staff member aside and asked if they were really giving away free ramen today.        The fresh flowers to congratulate a fresh shop gave me my answer.  Bario was serving anyone who walked by a free bowl of ramen on their opening day.        No ordering.  Everyone gets the same bowl.        The same great noodles and the same great soup.  And the same fabulous pork.  Very lean, which can be rare.  Usually \"manly\" ramen shops give you a chunk of pig fat, call it chashu, and expect you to be thankful.  Bario lets you get away with whatever level of manliness you subscribe to.        Though 3 scoops of garlic are what バリ男 eat.  Bari Otoko?  Burly Men?  Very Man?  Berrie Boys?        With this style, you are forgiven for not draining the bowl.  The amount of suspended fat bits and the layer of hot oil on the top could do some havoc.  So stop just below the 男, and leave, without touching your wallet.        Before leaving, a customer motioned me over to see his bowl.  Sure enough, a special message for those with iron stomachs.    I gave him my site's business card, and he gave me his.  It was none other than Mr. Tsujida, the head of one of the best shops in town.        Good luck Bario!  I'm glad I randomly stumbled by!

A single train from Tokyo Station can take you non-stop to the northern reaches of Aomori; another down south to the island of Kyushu (sorry ramen fans, there still isn't a direct link from Asahikawa to Kumamoto).  But one thing is simple and constant in this city; that lime green Yamanote line.A train comes every 3 minutes.  It takes an hour to loop the city.  It stops at almost every ramen hub in town.  Here are my top 5 ramen shops within a stone's throw of this iconic line.風雲児 - FuunjiFuunji's smoky fish flavored soup is rich and satisfying.  At first, I mistakingly thought it was a standard pork bone broth mixed with fish powders, with a few secret ingredients thrown in.  But it's actually made with chicken bones.  How they get so much thick umami out of that I don't know, but it's great.  Expect lines.My full writeup is here.Exit the JR Shinjuku Station South Exit and turn right on the main road.  Continue past the 1st large intersection.  At the next signal, cross the street and go down the road there.  You should pass a Starbucks coffee and police box on your right.  Fuunji is just past that on the right.Open 11-15, 17-21 Closed Sundays東京都渋谷区代々木2-14-3Tokyo, Shibuya-ku, Yoyogi 2-14-3鬼金棒 - KikanbouThe fiery bowl at Kikanbou gives you no choices, yet many.  By choosing your level of both their signature 10-spice kara mix and numbing sansho pepper shibi mix you can go from safe (and delicious) to dangerous (and delicious) as you will.My full writeup is here.Exit the Kanda Station and walk north along the tracks for a minute or 2.  Cross at the signal and turn right.  Walk another minute.  It's on a corner.Or watch this video.Open 11-16, 17:30-21Saturdays 11-16Closed Sundays東京都千代田区鍛冶町2-10-10Tokyo, Chiyoda-ku, Kajicho 2-10-10AFURIAt the forefront of the cafe-style ramen trend in Tokyo is AFURI.

Walk down the hill.  Just before the intersection at the bottom is an alley to the left.  Nishio is just down there.Open 11:30-15:30, 17:30-22東京都北区西ヶ原1-54-1Tokyo, Kita-ku, Nishigahara 1-54-1The Tokyo Ramen StreetA great selection of 8 different shops convene in the undergrounds of Tokyo Station.  This is your one-stop-shop to try some  of the best.  You could come here every day for a week and still tell your friends that you experienced some of the best noodling in the city.Now, there are only 4 shops, but from April 2011, there will be 8.  Shops on these ramen streets change, here are the 4 as of writing.KeisukeRokurinshaHirugaoMutsumiyaFrom Tokyo Station, look for signs, ask a station attendant, or just wander until you find it.  It's not hard, but hard to describe!Open 11-22I made a google map of these shops, but it doesn't always display correctly:http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=210923266256800335446.00049d03e8a19979bf444&z=13Yes, this list is flawed as there are no tonkotsu shops.  I was stumped for great tonkotsu that is within sight of the Yamanote.  ",

        "post": " ajito        I still get asked occasionally about the ice cream ramen I ate some time last year.  These people asking me surely aren't searching for the best bowl of noodles in town.  You can search for the perfect bowl, or you can search for the weirdest bowl.  It's your adventure!        Personally, I'm a big fan of the strange and unusual.  So when I heard of a hidden gem in the suburbs of Oimachi that served a pizza mazemen, it went on the list.        ajito is a bit hard to find.  I had a few travelling ramen fans from Singapore (by the way, check out my friend's blog for a Japanese ramen master's life in the city: Noodleholic) so the pressure was on.  The shop is very nondescript, the English lettering being the only way we would have found it without consulting the local police department (they always know).        Two choices, standard and butatama.  You can choose 3 sizes.  Go with the small size.  Medium was too much.        The butatama version, as slurped by my friends.        And the standard.  That is a pile of anchovy powder on top.  Freshly cut yellow and green peppers, onion, and tomato add a bit of health to the mix.  The salami was a great touch, they could have easily gone with some sort of sausage topping and still called it the same thing.  Noodles are standard tsukemen style, thick and heavy.  Again, heed the shop masters warning that the M is けっこ大き - a little big.  Oh, and there is a big pile of cheese under it all.        Fun stuff.      I made a video with AKB48 member Rena.

With a total of 3 days off this month, and 2 of those already spoken for with out of town hiking, searching out new ramen shops has taken a bit of a break.  And to continue the apologies; sorry for this review!  The adventure behind this shop is based on the fact that it is close to a major bookstore, where I was perusing ramen mags.Kitanodaichi is stuffed into one of the hundreds of buildings in the area around Shinjuku station.  The menu has a few choices, though the 北 - kita in the title pushed me to try one of their miso offerings. Cheese and mushroom miso ramen.  The mushrooms were a nice touch, and I'd like to see them paired with miso more often.  The rest of the bowl was rather normal.Better reviews on the way!View Larger MapMore Info Here  ",

        "post": " ボニート ボニートVegetarian ramen does exist, but the one or two times I've come across it has been a complete failure.  Climbing the meat-acceptance ladder usually brings us to the pescetarian.  Although rare, ramen with only fish does exist.  Until now, the only one worth mentioning was Ivan Plus.  Enter Bonito Bonito*.Bonito around the world.  Also known as katsuo in Japan.  I almost never hear the English used word, skipjack tuna.  It looks like the origin is Italian.  The more you know.The menu has a few items, though everything revolves around the shops arabiki blend, a fish powder made from katsuo and niboshi.The sardine and skipjack powder is blended with a simple stock and shoyu.  Before coming in, I expected the soup would be in the udon style.  Thin and clear.The rough blend ended up being thick and cloudy.  Bits of fish flakes coat every noodle.  Continuing the rough theme, Bonito Bonito uses thick chunks of menma from Kyushu, though I wouldn't call them that.  More like takenoko.  It's great stuff.If you didn't get enough katsuo, pick up some products on the way out.*I can't guarantee the ingredients anywhere on this site.  To be honest, many Japanese people I've met don't seem to understand the concept of vegetarian or pescetarian.  The absence of visible meat chunks is often enough for some people to consider a meal meatless.  And it could be that one of the vegetable ingredients was roasted in chicken oil or lard.

That's not a sure-fire indication of success, as just about any tonkotsu gyokai seems to get a bump in their reviews.  But surely Mendokoro Honda, which is sitting at the coveted #1 position for 2011 should be excellent.It seems that every station along the Kehin-Tohoku line, from Ueno to Omiya, is a bustling night spot.  It makes sense, as many (around a million according to government data) hard working salarymen in Tokyo leave the city for cheaper residence up towards Saitama.I like the logo, though I'd take a Honda over a Harley any day.特製濃厚豚骨魚介らーめん - Special thick pork and fish soup ramenWorthy of high regards.  The meat on the left is more of a peppered pastrami style.  The rest of it great, though I'm curious why they are ranked higher than other equally delicious shops.  Maybe it's because the trek out to Higashi Jujo station builds anticipation as well as hunger.  Or maybe it's that the shop offers other things, like a trendy shio.Mendokoro Honda will be at the Tokyo Ramen Street from April, I'm very curious to see them go head to head with Rokurinsha.View Larger MapMore Info Here  ",

Don't get your hopes up, it's just a Tokyo pocket atlas, with a little post-it note for every shop that I want to try in the future.  But, alas, I usually only write the name and address, not the shop's hours.  So TMD420G (that's the ramen shop's name) was closed when I arrived.  Further research indicated that it is actually closed for good.  The ramen radar pointed me to the nearest noodle-serving shop.  School Food?韓国料理, Koean food.  Maybe they have some ramyeon.  They sure have a lot of K-pop posters.And they sure have a lot of Jinro.There it is.  I ordered a bowl of ramen and a side of kimchi gimbap.  I watched as the chef opened a packet of dried instant ramen.The addition of eggs and greens didn't bring this bowl to any higher state.  Don't get me wrong, Korean instant noodles are a go-to winner for an easy bite.  It really should have been just 300 yen though, 500 is a bit pricey for what was served.No info, but  found this tasty looking shop with the same name in NY and Korea.  Obviously a different place.

And my return to Japan was uncertain.  Noticing that the opening date could possibly be after my flight, I asked the staff, busy with preparations, for some info.  After some formal trading of business cards, I was invited to a VIP tasting event later that night.  Always carry official looking business cards, and always be ready for an adventure. Later in the day, I found the shop's rookie staff in a nearby park, waiting for the boss to call them back in.  Cool kids, good luck with you're Japanese studies!Once again, you get a questionnaire style order sheet.  Once again, I had to ask for the Japanese version.  A lot of options here.  I'm guessing a lot of the slurpers will be intoxicated people finishing up their drinking session in nearby LKF.  Go ahead and check off garlic, it's healthy for a hangover.On the menu: White, Black, Red.The red comes with a healthy dose of hot.  Hong Kong people have a bit more of a tolerance for spice, as evident here.  Be careful!The black adds a little mayu to the mix.As for the ramen, it could use some work.  I think they took it down a bit to cater to the Hong Kong palette.  Not so rich and creamy, and a bit heavy on the spice.  I think back to the limited Hide-Chan I had a few months ago, and am surprised at how different the taste is.The shop, on the other hand, is gorgeous.  A massive wooden counter, where every step of the ramen making process is viewable to the customers, both in the shop and on the street.  Jet black walls, highlighted by a lone red lamp in the entrance.  Loud music.  Even though the food wasn't as good as it could be, this shop has all the makings of a trend setter.If you give it a try, let me know what you think.  I'd love to hear what some Hong Kong natives think.  I would especially like to hear people's comparisons of Hide-Chan and Butao.  Both with roots in Kyushu tonkatsu, but taking very different steps in the foreign market.On April 1st, all proceeds will go to the Red Cross to support Japan.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " 豚王An unexpected extension of my spring break in Hong Kong left me with a lot of extra time.  My 5 day limited adventures left little room for ramen.  My new 3 week vacation gave me nothing but free time.  But let me say, Nagi's first overseas shop, Butao, was definitely scheduled in the 5 day version.I rolled up at about 3pm and asked the staff if they would be open a little later at 6pm.  \"Sorry, we are already almost out of soup for the day\".  Maybe it was my use of Japanese, or the fact that master chef Ikota-san recognized me, but the last 2 bowls of the day were mine.You see, serving up a mere 200 bowls a day means a heavily weighted supply and demand curve.  The line is easily 2 hours throughout the day, and shows no sign of slowing up.Taking a page out of *shudder* ichiran's book, you are given a multiple choice questionnaire to help decide.  Please note, if you want Japanese, you'll have to ask for it; the default is Chinese and English.Four choices: Normal, Black, Red, and Green.My friend went with the green.  Basil olive oil and parmesan cheese add an interesting touch.  Untraditional, but good if you want a change from the norm.I went with the black.  Now we're talking.  What is that thing anyways?Black usually means a drizzle of mayu, burnt garlic oil.  But Butao's black ball was a total mystery.  If I had to crack a guess, I would say it's ground pork flavored with miso and colored with squid ink.  Just a shot in the dark though.I'm happy to say that Butao brought it.  They really took what is great about thick tonkotsu ramen and introduced it to Hong Kong.  Creamy and rich.For those keeping score, it's very similar to their Shibuya shop.Do me a favor, try it before you search the internet for reviews.  Hong Kong's immensely popular openrice.com seems to suffer from the same problem as America's yelp.com.  Haters.  On the other hand, thick, oily tonkotsu is definitely not a Hong Kong taste.  Many reviewers point this out.  The negative press is moot though, just look at the line.I'd love to say it's the best ramen in Hong Kong, but I only tried one other shop.  Most ramen in Hong Kong looks like the type you'd get at a shopping mall food court or the airport.If you live and work in Hong Kong, it might be tough to take a few hours out of your day.  But if you are just passing through, do yourself a favor and get in that line.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " 新 東京らーめんチャンピオンI have no excuse for not coming to this event earlier.  I have a legitimate excuse for not coming to it recently.  And I gave it a big chance that when I rolled into the skyscraper district on a Sunday night at 8pm that I would end up missing out completely.  Tokyo is doing it's part to conserve energy in the wake of the Tohoku tragedy.  That means shutting down early, turning off the lights, and closing down shop for many of the city's eateries.  The gleaming towers of Shinjuku, which usually stay ablaze 24 hours a day, were ghostlike.But up on the 49th floor of the Sumitomo building, the 3 month long Tokyo Ramen Champion event was still going strong.  Twelve shops entered, and it's down to the final 4.  Who will come out on top.  With powerhouses Nantsutei and Keisuke in the running, it will be hard for underdogs Tanaka and Kibi to compete.  But who knows, maybe there will be a... let's see... Butler winning against Florida style upset (I'll admit I had to look up who is in the NCAA finals for that reference).As half bowls are on the board, eating 4 bowls is no problem for this seasoned vet.A random shuffle of my tickets and I was soon waiting for a bowl of Nantsutei's creation.Only a few days left, I would think that this place would be more packed.  Three more days everyone!  The event is over on March 31st.Nantsutei's rich tonkotsu base with the addition of コク style miso.  Thick and rich.  As if that wasn't enough, uni cream is added for creamy undertones; and the chashu is actually grilled with cheese on top.This was one rocking bowl.  Grilling cheese onto meat alone is a recipe for tasty, but dump it into a pork/miso/uni soup and it's on a whole other level.  Oh, the noodles were good too.Sinasoba Kibi brings their \"version up\" pork to the plate.  Inspired by Mexican carnitas, this is as flavorful and succulent as it gets.  The chicken and pork soup is accentuated by a shio tare base, using roasted salt.The addition of tomato and herbs gives it a very western taste.Next up was shodai keisuke's miso creation.  Is there ramen under all those toppings?  I see an egg (a quarter of one at least), nori, cloud ear mushroom, chunks of pork, menma, and a beautiful piece of pressure cooked chashu.  Nice!The soup is packed full of ワタリガニ - Portunus trituberculatus.  A fancy name for the common Blue Crab.  Keisuke is known for using a lot of seafood (his shops use spiny lobster, shrimp, and crab among other seafood ingredients).  Like most of Keisuke's creations, this one caused a big divide in opinions.Last on the list was Tanaka with their Kitakyushu style nikusoba.  A fancy name for simple.  This shio broth topped with a few pieces of excellent chashu and rich menma was a good way to finish my marathon eating session.  The group sitting next to me, young Japanese drumming circle friends, said this was tops.  Amidst some interesting experiments in ramen, Tanaka was the most true to the game.Four spoons, four votes.Just drop them into the bin of your choice.Or vote for none.  There was actually one spoon in there.How did I vote?  3 spoons for ??? and 1 spoon for ???. I'm not telling!But I will say that it should be a close vote.  Although the 4 dreadlocked drummers went with Tanaka, the 7 year old boy on my other side was clearly in favor of Keisuke.  \"He likes crab,\" papa informed me.Event Page HereView Larger Map  ",

A nice break from the usual heavy soups that I tend to find myself eating of late.Can't find the shop?  Look for the cute kitty brick on the ground.Standard ramen with the shop's super won ton.Simple, light, warming.  Making the soup is a 10 hour process involving choice chicken parts and scallops, among other things.Make sure you get the won tons, they are some of the best I've had.I'm glad I tried their standard ramen, but the limited cheese fondue tsukemen was calling to me.  It's only a few minutes from my apartment, so I'll try and make it back someday.View Larger MapSupleks dB  ",

        "post": " 無鉄砲    Muteppo is highly ranked.  Sure, there are a dozen or so publications and websites with ramen rankings, but when your shop is on almost all of them, there's got to be something special about it.    Less than 6 months old, they already have a devout following.  All I knew going in was that it is a tonkotsu shop.  I was expecting creamy white soup with the standard toppings.    The staff asked how I wanted my noodles cooked.  A usual question.  But then, they asked if seiabura, back fat, was ok.  That is definitely not a standard tonkotsu question.  Of course, I accepted.    Wow.  Intense hardly describes what is going on here.    The shop uses over 300kg of roasted pork bones a day.  You can bet the impact is there.  This is the definition of kotteri, thick and rich.    Top it with some soy marinated garlic slices.    My apologies to anyone sitting next to me on the train.    Another bonus, you can order a free side of light soup to add.  Choose from either a fish broth or a light tonkotsu broth.    For certain one of the most intense tonkotsu ramens out there.    By the way, according to their website, they have a branch in Sydney.  Any ramen adventurers down under?  I'd love to here about it.  Check out my video review here!

        "post": " 喜多方屋Kitakata is a city in the north of Fukushima prefecture.  In recent days, the press coming from this region of Japan is, of course, non-stop.  Usually, they say that any press is good press.  But in the case of local foods from near the Tohoku disaster area, it's going to be a bad year for business.  Kitakataya uses many of these local ingredients, some of which have stopped coming in due to a sudden downturn in production.  But just as the shelves of the supermarkets are slowly showing signs of bottled water, Kitakataya is doing ok.The menu at Kitakataya is large.  Although a ramen shop, it is also a local restaurant.  Families from the neighborhood poured in for their evening dinner.  Though I wouldn't expect a line here, a large group may have to wait a bit for a table.The gyoza and slices of chashu go great with the obligatory beer.For those more adventurous, try some fresh basashi.  It comes fresh from Kitakata, and the shop master, Saito-san, has actually had some trouble getting enough of it lately.  Kitakata basashi is much leaner and more tender than basashi from other parts of Japan.  Some say it's the water.  By the way, basashi is raw horse meat.  It's really good.As is the ramen.  Much of the ingredients here are sourced locally from up north.  Kitakata noodles are known to be some of the best in Japan.You can order a few different kinds, though I suggest the standard Kitakata Ramen or the Kotteri Ramen, which adds a bit of fat to the soup.Another thing Kitakata is known for is Japanese sake.You can try a lot of Kitakata sake here.  They tended to be a bit sweeter than, say Niigata sakes.Working here for almost 30 years, Saito-san cooks almost everything himself.From cutting slices of the homemade chashu, to frying up vegetables,to pouring glasses of his own brand of sake.More Shop InfoView Larger Map  ",

        "post": "  東京ラーメンストリートのグランドオープン        The Tokyo Ramen Street, a collection of shops in the basement of massive Tokyo Station, is, or was I should say, a great place to try some ramen in the metropolis.  But with the addition of 4 more shops, bringing the total to 8, I'd upgrade it to a must-slurp spot on the Tokyo ramen scene.  Sure, almost every shop here has a main branch in the greater Tokyo area, but bringing so many great shops into one local needs to be seen.    I've already written about (and done collaboration videos for) the original 4 shops.  Check them out:    Keisuke - A word of note, the shop has a new taste.  Crab now, instead of shrimp  Rokurinsha  Hiragao  Mutsumiya    Introducing the 4 new shops.        Shichisai.  The original branch near Nerima station is ramen perfection.  Handmade noodles, absolutely zero preservatives, and the best chashu in Tokyo.        You can watch noodles being freshly made.  The design of the shops, as well as the shared space in the Ramen Street, is very well done.  I'm not sure how it will look with the inevitable lines that are sure to form.        It should be noted that at night this shop will become a miso shop.  I wasn't there at night.        Shichisai lives up to my review of the main shop.  The flavorful shoyu accentuated by the perfect slices of stewed pork.  The egg is a rich and gooey treat.  I want to have that chashu and egg as an option at other shops!  If your noodles aren't doing it for you, just order the \"shichisai topping option\" to be saved.  These noodles need no saving.        Next up is Ikaruga.  When The NY Times wrote about ramen last year, this was their perfect bowl.  I've been to the shop in Kudanshita a few times, and was blown away by the creamy tonkotsu broth.  Silky and rich, it was a great place for a date.  The lighting dim, the staff in smart, black uniforms.        The Ramen Street version has a few choices.        This is the original.  We (Keizo and Hiroshi) were here on a special press day, and it took longer than usual for these noodles to come out.  The kinks in the system on opening day, I hope, affected the taste.  Something was off.  It was a little sour.        The cheese mazemen tastes like a ramen version of pasta a la carbonara.  They use a few kinds of high quality cheese.  If you live in Tokyo, chunks of Parmesan are a rare commodity.        The tsukemen had a spicy kick and uses a richer version of their tonkotsu soup.        Honda's original shop is a bit inconvenient, a 15 minute walk away from a station in the north of Tokyo.  Their Ramen Street shop is a welcome addition.        There are a few choices.        The shio is light and refreshing.  A rather large dollop of yuzu-wasabi, stewed cherry tomatoes, and spinach make this possibly the healthiest bowl on The Street.        Be careful with that wasabi though.        Other options include a simple shoyu.        And an excellent Ramen Street only miso tsukemen.  I recommend the tsukemen.  It takes the thick chicken and seafood broth I loved from the original shop and mixes it with even more flavor.        Last is...        Junk Garage.  The original shop is way out north in Saitama.  Junk Garage was a ramen epiphany for me.  How can something so horrible looking be so wonderful.  I was worried that this time, having eaten 3 bowls in less than 2 hours, I would be put off by the sheer mass of calories that constitutes a bowl here.        They, like some other shops, have a special menu item that is only available at The Ramen Street.        Thick noodles, cheese, raw egg, bonito flakes, fried noodle bits, mayonnaise.  But there's more!        You dip it into 2 different soups.  Soup might be the wrong word.  Sauce seems more appropriate.        Despite having loosened my belt a few notches already, I couldn't stop eating this.  It's almost shockingly good.  The black sauce has hints of curry, and the dark mayu, burnt garlic oil, coats every noodle.  The lighter sauce, with lighter only being applied to the color, had slight hints of sesame and not so slight hints of garlic.        The shop and staff match the food.  Though the original shop is unrefined, heavy metal on the speakers, you can still expect a bit of the countryside at the Ramen Street branch.        By the way, if you come to the Ramen street during opening week, April 8th to 17th, you can get some free presents.  I think it's just a folder, maybe a poster, maybe some Ramen Street tissues.  Come for the noodles though.    Here's the official site of the Ramen Street.    No map needed.  Just go to Tokyo Station and look for the signs.  It's on the eastern, Yaesu exit side.          ",

It will take a lot of organization, time, and money.Nagi did a special soup for their fundraising day.  仙台豚汁ラーメン is a heartwarming mix of ramen and tonjiro.  Tonjiro is a pork and vegetable soup that I ate almost everyday when I was working in a Japanese Junior High.  Salty shoyu, sweet mirin, and umami dashi soak into the chunks of carrot and daikon radish.Typical tonkotsu soup will be too difficult to make up in Sendai.  The amount of fuel needed to simmer pork bones for days on end is simply too much.  Shops will have to forgo their typical recipes and focus more on quantity.Tonjiro is usually just a soup.  A side dish.  With Nagi's thick noodles, it became the main course.Great work guys.  ",

Let's just say they're not for kids.Yet another in the tonkotsu gyokai tsukemen field.  Enji sets itself apart by using a secret vegetable paste in their soup, along with pork, chicken, fish, and even some shrimp.  The darker than average noodles match perfectly.I like the use of a bamboo screen in the bowl.  Soggy bottom noodles are no fun.If you're adventurous, the shop recommends a little habanero spice powder.  It ads some serious kick, obviously.  If you can read Japanese, you are warned of this fact.  If you don't, you'll learn the hard way.Supleks DatabaseView Larger Map  ",

At the mention of ramen, he was quick to recommend a few spots.  Sanpa has a few shops in Tokushima, and a week later I found myself staying near one of them.A local favorite, they make a monthly newspaper, featuring fan art from neighborhood children.Oh, the ramen.  It's great.  I was told it's the best chashu on Shikoku, and I'll agree with that 100%.  Even though I've only had pork in chashu form a couple times out here, this tender and rich cut of meat gets my vote.  The tonkotsu shoyu soup is a little different from the accepted Tokushima style.Tokushima was an interesting place.  Nice beaches, an interesting array of nightlife, and plenty of good food.  But a few hours after eating here, I loaded my motorcycle up and drove off into the sunrise.View Larger Map徳島県徳島市北田宮2-467Tokushima-ken, Tokushima-shi, Kitatamiya 2-467Open 10:30-20:00Closed Tuesdays and the 3rd Monday of the month  ",

This shop. sitting above a local bank/gift shop, sold everything from hamburgers to fried rice.  I was running late to my campsite, but my ramen research led me to discover that this area, Suzaki, created it's own style of ramen.  My research also led me to a better looking shop.        That's Mayumi, a nice lady from the countryside who has been serving up nabe-yaki for some time now.  By the way, nabe is a clay pot, usually reserved for stews.  The earthen ware is heated, and the ramen served inside.  Mind your fingers... is something almost no one does, and shouts of itai can be heard. Ouch!        Followed by sighs of umai.  It's delicious.        Very similar to it's neighbor, Tokushima ramen, Suzaki ramen differs with the noodles and toppings.  The noodles are cooked very firm, and will continue to cook inside the hot pot.  The egg, too, will cook.  Quick decisions need to be made.  I dipped my noodles in the egg Tokushima style, then ate the egg white hard.  Good stuff!        I was a bit shocked to see that this sleepy seaside town has it's own ramen map with over 30 shops serving nabe-yaki ramen.  It made me realize that the adventure will never be over.

All of which are excellent.Inotani decided to break ground though, and now there are countless Tokushima-style ramen shops around the prefecture.

The instructions are long.  Cook and serve is not in the cards.  Be sure you warm your bowl?!When cooking noodles for this long, there is a lot of room for error.

The type of soup that only comes from hours, even days, of simmering animal bones.The staff offered me a fork, which hasn't happened in a while.

        "post": " Pour cafeYamagata ramen was the adventure of the day, and the most notable place serving it in Tokyo is a cafe in Ginza.Espresso with your ramen?  Go for it.The most popular ramen here is the Yamagata sui-ramen.  A cold bowl, make that ice-cold bowl, that I don't really have much interest in.  Moving past the soy milk curry and locomoco lunch sets, the Yamagata ramen (not frozen!) was an easy choice.That's Yamagata prefecture up there if you were curious.  Yamagata is famous for red dye and expensive cherries.  It's also one of the least visited prefectures in this country.  Countryside life leads to hearty, rustic foods, and Yamagata ramen follows that thinking.The rich soup is a bit out of place in posh Ginza, where the streets are full of nouveau riche tourists from other Asian countries these days.  But the rich shoyu soup is in no way out of place with me.  It's great.  I don't have many words, just that Pour cafe is a nice relaxing place to have a drink and a bowl of ramen.  The flavor is very \"meaty\".I managed to cross off another from my list.  These days they come off faster than they go on.  But they never stop going on.View Larger Map東京都中央区銀座1-14-9Tokyo, Chuo-ku, Ginza 1-14-9Nearest station: Metro Ginza or Metro Ginza 1-chomeOpen 7:30-23:30Friday 7:30-1:00amSaturday 9:00-23:30Sunday 9:00-18:00Ramen is only served after 11:30!

And, of course, this city has it's own ramen style.At least, that is what I was led to understand when I found this place.  Despite the chain feel (other shops are located in nearby Otsuka and Ikebukuro), I had high hopes when reading the plaque on the wall proclaiming the wonders of Yonezawa ramen, and the shop's use of some Yonezawa ingredients.I went with the standard shoyu ramen, plus a side of fried rice.  Like it's nearby neighbor to the south, Kitakata, it's a simple bowl.Simple in all ways.  There are some much better shops in the area, like Nishio Ramen, but Ai Ai is open at all hours practically.  I guess it has that going for it.When I asked the chef to explain Yonezawa ramen to me, he grunted and said, \"It's where I'm from.\"  I continued my interview by asking what Yonezawa local ingredients he uses.  \"Just the noodles.\"  It was a short interview.At least it's close to the station.A few days later I was drinking with a friend, a native of Yonezawa, and asked her what is so special about her hometown noodles.  Her explanation was a little more eloquent.  \"When us countryside girls come to the big city, everyone is eating tonkotsu soup; strong-smelling, thick stuff.  But back home, we really just love a warm bowl made with our clean mountain water.  It's simple, and good.\"View Larger Map東京都豊島区駒込1-28-14Tokyo, Toshima-ku, Komagome 1-28-14Nearest station: KomagomeOpen 11:00-5:00am  ",

I've never been disappointed by a highly ranked (90+) shop on that database.  At the time of writing, Tomita is sitting at 97.396. The supleks database leans far left, with liberal party being traditional shoyu and green party being new, robust pork soups.  Tonkotsu gyokai tsukemen in particular tends to be ranked high.    Matsudo is surprisingly closer to Tokyo than I thought.  Often, a shop in a neighboring prefecture requires a few hours of dedicated time.  At less than 20 minutes from the Yamanote line, Tomita is closer than many inner city shops.        Expect to wait.  One staff member is on duty full time, letting you know when and where to sit in line, when to buy your ticket, and when to enter the store.  A lot of people bought a take home pack.  No wait for that one.        Here it is, the coveted tonkotsu gyokai tsukemen from Tomita.  Any popular tsukemen will have something about it.  Something extra.  Most shops of this kind are just good.  Rising above \"just good\", Tomita's soup is a little grainy, with tiny flecks of fish and pork bits sticking to everything that comes in contact.          Superb.  Little details, like the last minute splash of boiling soup to keep it the right temperature, were noted.        The shop will try and serve everyone at once, so that the master can focus on one thing at a time.        Mr. Tomita may only cook ramen for 5 hours a day at lunch, but he also oversees the handmade noodles, and apparently operates a few other restaurants in the neighborhood.  I think if he were to walk down the street here in Matsudo, every local greet him with praise.  Perhaps he isn't seen walking down the street too often though, as he lives just upstairs according to this video:            When you ask for it, the soup owari, broth added to the soup after your noodles are finished, is the best I've had in Japan.        At a typical shop, it's just clear broth.  Tomita adds that broth, along with ground pork and fresh yuzu peel.  You'll leave refreshed, and likely thinking about the next time you can make it back.

Ramen is a natural hangover prevention tactic, and I'm sure no one in the group gave any protest.  It's also a hangover cure.  A panacea for all occasions.The shop is in a hip neighborhood, and you just might meet a tattooed ramen-fan baby.  Maybe.One would assume that a shop named Kushu would be in the style of Kyushu, a rich tonkotsu soup.  And that's what it was.  A fatty bowl for the late night crowd.99.9% of the time that I'm in this part of town, Dokkan is the bowl of choice.

        "post": " Daniel, author of How to Japonese, was back in Japan for the summer.  Just in time for the recent opening of 4 new shops in the Tokyo Ramen Street.  Here you go, not only are these shops great, but the convenience of being in Tokyo Station can't be beat. First up was Shichisai.  Perfect pork on a refined bowl of ramen.  Next up was Junk Garage.  If you only have 1 place to go, and you want a memorable bowl of ramen that is as far from what you think of ramen as possible, this is the place.  People from overseas would usually head to Ramen Jiro for the most extreme bowl, but Junk Garage is my choice.Ikaruga's creamy soup is superb, one of the best bowls in Japan, but on opening day something went wrong and it was really bitter.  That's the risk when cooking with niboshi, those little dried sardines that flavor many bowls.  Cook them too long and you have problems.  This 2nd time to the shop was good, but you can tell my reluctance in the video.  I rarely give a shop a 2nd chance!Lastly was Honda.  A solid tonkotsu gyokai that many people say is the best in Tokyo.  You might notice that we drink a lot of beer in these videos.  Nothing compliments fatty, rich ramen better than cold beer.  ",

Check.Jumbled exterior, full of discarded noodle containers, empty kegs, and expensive road bikes.  Local feel from the outside.  Check.Eclectic interior with piles of popped tops amongst bicycle tools.  Local feel on the inside.  Check.Chopsticks laid out on pieces of coral.  Artistic creativity.  Check.And some late-night-drunk ramen.  Check.Actually, I was fairly sober at the time I enjoyed this bowl.  Sober enough to think that the にんにく卵, garlic egg, soup would be the one for me.  The shop actually has four different soups simmering in the back.  This one was intense.  A shock of garlic and pork.  The shops opens for lunch, but I would never ever get this if the prospect of face-to-face contact might occur in the next 12 hours.  Not as pungent as popping a spoonful of raw crushed into your bowl, which is the norm at many shops.  Ten's soup is infused with the stuff, and you will be reeking of it after.My local spot used to be the superb Sengoku Jiman, but a quick move across town negated the possibility of any more 1:00am visits there.  And though a mere 30 minutes away on just about any mode of transportation, there is no way I can go more than a few blocks at times.

My 2nd, 3rd, and 4th words are not fit for a ramen review site.  Baka means stupid by the way.  Thanks kids!          So Menbakamusuko serves up some stupid noodles.  But the point of this adventure was to check out their upcoming limited ramen.        Made with spicy Korean miso, and topped with some distinctly Korean tasting sirloin slices, this is sure to be a local hit.  Korean miso is a bit sweeter than it's Japanese counterpart.          Back to the baka.  This shop has 3 different sizes of noodles for their standard tsukemen.  Regular, fat, and stupid.  The stupid size noodles are more like bacon size strips of dough.  The cooking time is longer, and definitely worth it.  Not pictured is the soup, a standard deal that didn't stand out in any way.  But the noodles were excellent.        It's nice to see that, along with the stupid tsukemen, they offer an aromatic chicken shio ramen.  Topped with some baby bamboo shoots, this is a very artistic looking dish.        Something for everyone!        I was here shooting with Weekly プレイーボイ magazine, for an upcoming seasonal ramen special.

Further research shows that Taiwan ramen actually originated west of Tokyo, in Nagoya.  To make matters even more unclear, this shop has a few dozen different side dishes, most of which are very Chinese.I would rather skip the semantics, and get down to the food.  The menu at this unassuming corner shop does you the benefit of highlighting recommendations.  With a few beers, a small group could make it through the entire list and walk away happy.The Taiwan ramen.  A beef based shoyu soup is hit with a spicy oil.  Spicy is an overstatement though.  Tangy might be a better way to describe it.  At only 500 yen, this would be a regular eat for me if I lived out in Kokuryo, 30 minutes west of the main city.The deep-fried eggs are an interesting topping.Jya-jya-men.Su-ra-tanmen.  Basically hot (ra) and sour (su) soup with ramen noodles.  Excellent.The spotlight dish was definitely the black vinegar stewed pork.  Having seen and smelled it at the table next to us, we wasted little time ordering up a plate.  Melt-in-your-mouth boneless pork.  So rich.As with many cheap Chinese spots in Tokyo, Miko has a large-ish menu, full of wok-fried eats and vinegar heavy dishes.  But unlike most, the quality here is high enough to make it a local favorite.View Larger Map東京都調布市国領町2-3-6Tokyo, Chofu, Kokuryo 2-3-6Closest station: KokuryoOpen 11:00am-1:00amClosed Mondays  ",

I am lucky enough to have jobs that I enjoy, and one of them sends me on adventures to unknown locations far and wide within the greater metropolitan area.Today was Myoden, somewhere out in Chiba.  The hand-drawn map made by my company staff featured, you bet, a ramen shop.  Meant to help me reach the classroom on time, it had the inadvertent benefit of steering me to lunch.Kabuden is a typical Chinese style ramen shop.  Jack of all trades, master of none.The shrimp wonton ramen was a good choice, with half a dozen fat wontons to make the rather normal bowl a bit better.No smoking in town, but you can smoke in the shop.

Though, if you really get down to it, it is the wheat and meat that make this place neat.Momonoki is part of the famed Setagaya group.  Like most of the shops veiled under this ramen powerhouse, things get fairly unique here.Tsukemen is on order, and I went a little crazy with both the egg and W-cheese toppings.  By the way, the letter W is pronounced daburu in Engrish.  \"Double\" is also pronounced daburu.  No that you know you will see it all over the place.Very refined.  The soup is a bit lighter than other tsukemen shops, shifting the focus towards the excellent noodles a bit.  It is usually tough to put light and tsukemen in the same sentence.  This shop might be the exception.The flat noodles are chewy, wheaty, and wonderful.The chef instructed that the egg go in the noodles, and the cheese in the soup.  At first bite, I realized that I had gone a bit overboard.  This was a rich combination!This shop is staffed entirely by pink-uniformed ladies.  Adding to the lady appeal, a side tray offers aprons, hair ties, hair pins, and stain removing drops lest some tsukemen splatter make its way onto your clothes.  Hmmm, which is more attractive though, a lovely lady with a flawless Hermes shawl, or a lovely lady with said shawl stained by proof of ramen?View Larger MapOfficial Site Here東京都新宿区新宿1-32-4Tokyo, Shinjuku-ku, Shinjuku 1-32-4Closest station: Shinjuku GyoenmaeOpen 11:00-around 5:00 (until they sell 120 orders)Closed Sundays and the 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month  ",

Some chefs just want to make their ramen in peace.  Sorry for the upcoming positive review of your shop!Tatsuya is another jiro-kei shop.  Tonkotsu shoyu in the style of famed Ramen Jiro.  You can tell by the odoriferous pot of boiling meat parts and the lack of women in the seats.  Everyone ordered the Tatsu Shoyu Ramen.  Regulars customized their orders by varying the amount of toppings and asking for curry powder.  Be careful though, customization is only in the upwards direction of volume, and will only get a beginner in trouble.  And even though I have eaten at close to 400 different ramen shops in Japan, I still consider myself a beginner in the world of jiro-kei.As it comes.  Brimming with hot meat liquid, the only way to eat this bowl is to slowly burrow through the mound of cabbage on top.  Once you have achieved a tunnel in, you can start rescuing the trapped noodles.  Do all of this slowly, lest you cover your clothes with hot meat liquid splatter.There you go.  The bonito flake topping is a great touch, adding some flair to a rather thuggish bowl of noodles.You are not expected to drink the soup.  You are actually not even expected to touch a spoon.  If you can finish the greater part of the noodles and cabbage, you have done enough for one day.View Larger Map東京都世田谷区世田谷4-13-20Tokyo, Setagaya-ku, Setagaya 4-13-20Closest station: Shoinjinjamae (Setagaya Line)Open 11:30-15:00, 18:00-22:00Sundays only lunchClosed Mondays  ",

Welcome to Akihabara.The day I go for 24 hours without seeing some sort of reference to AKB48, whether it is on the morning news, 30% of station advertisements, or being played on the supermarket's stereo is the day I quit eating ramen.  There are many bowls ahead.Akihabara has had some surprises in the realm of ramen, namely Matsukaze.  What else is around, I wonder.The bright yellow sign, and the unmistakable ニンニク入れます (ya want garlic in that?) is an homage to Ramen Jiro.  I avoid Ramen Jiro like the plague.Of the 2 menu items, mazesoba and mazesoba with extra meat, the shop recommends the bowl with extra meat.  Sure, why not.This is the bowl with all the toppings.  You can get more of any topping (cheese, pork fat, garlic, spice, and vegetables) for no charge, just ask for it.Well, it was as heavy as it looks.  I wasn't really into this bowl.  There was a lot of liquid in it, which isn't what I want in mazesoba.  I think of mazesoba as more of just noodles in fat and salt and flavor.  Soup just washes off the fat.  We can't have that.It might just be that Junk Garage ruined me toward all other mazesoba.View Larger Map東京都千代田区神田佐久間町1-14Tokyo, Chioda-ku, Kanda Sakumacho 1-14Closest station: AkihabaraOpen 11:30-15:00, 17:30-22:00Closed Sundays and holidays  ",

But when a student of mine insisted that I try her favorite tantanmen shop in Tokyo, I know I had to be there.  Since our lesson ends at 3pm, and this shop closes at 3pm, getting there for the 11am opening was the adventure of the day.  Hey, Wednesday is my sleep-in day!Tantanmen is all about layers of spice.  It's simple to make something spicy.  But to make that spice meld into newer, exciting flavors, therein lies the test.Rustic tools to crush your own sesame seeds are a good sign.As is an inventive bowl topped with ishinori, an uncommon topping for this type of ramen (or any type for that matter).  Ron Fan delivered on the layers, and the initial spice kick was quickly subdued by the creamy soup.  Soon the numbing pepper, wonderful 山椒, did it's thing.  An excellent bowl.Free rice at lunch would be worth the extra 100 yen at dinner.  Rice really grabs the soup.  By now the ishinori has all but dissolved, leaving its salty essence in the broth.They also offer up black tantanmen and a super spicy version.View Larger Map東京都練馬区桜台1-6-7Tokyo, Nerima-ku, Sakuradai 1-6-7Closest station: SakuradaiOpen 11:00-15:00, 17:00-1:00amSunday 11:00-22:00  ",

Every experience I have had here, and by here I mean deep Kabukicho, has been at the introduction of a more savvy Japanese friend.Who could possibly know that one of these tiny clubs actually has a kitchen where they serve homemade ramen.We ordered a few drinks, and a couple bowls to share with the group.  Enka was on the karaoke machine, and some chicken stock was being heated in the back.The homemade liquor reeked of peat, but luckily we had already been out for a few hours before this, and alcohol of any grade had simply become more booze.The soup was overly salty, just what one would expect at a bar.  Apparently Leonardi Di Caprio came to this same spot.  Not sure if he had the ramen.The owner, as is customary, saw us off to the elevator.  The hostess with the 2 hour hair and sulky disposition didn't play into the equation.  ",

        "post": " 神名備I can say that, as of this writing, that I have been to Kamunabi with the intent of eating ramen 6 times.  I can also say that I have only eaten there once.  Even this time, a hand scrawled sign apologized, \"We will be opening 15 minutes late today.\"Needless to say I waited the extra time.The vibe here is very friendly.  When I ordered the shoyu ramen with extra pork, she asked me if I would rather have shio, as it is a little easier to eat.  I shrugged it off and stuck with the shoyu.  By the way, the ramen with extra pork is pricey, at 1200 yen.  A regular bowl comes in at 800 yen.Don't touch!Here is what came out.  Honestly, I was a bit worried at all that pork.  And it looks a little dry, don't you think?  Eating a mass of dried out chashu is not a fun task.That ends the negative speculation of this bowl.  Turns out the dry appearance was because this flavorful meat is almost like a sponge, soaking up the dark amber soup.  It's really good.  Suddenly I could understand why this shop consistently runs out before the day is through.  The first taste of soup is remarkably refreshing and light.  Vegetable flavors come through in abundance.  Then you go onto the meat, tender and juicy if you have pushed it into the broth.  And by the time you are at the end, that light taste is back.Other homemade menu items, like the seasonal onigiri (matsutake mushroom for October) and a couple kinds of puddings were enticing, but the 1200 yen is a bit dear.  If you are a fan of chashu in your ramen, live a little, this place is up there.View Larger Map東京都文京区千駄木4-21-3Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Sendagi 4-21-3Closest station: Nishi-NipporiOpen 11:30-15:30Weekends 12:00-15:00, 18:00-21:00Closed Monday and Tuesday  ",

The grand daddy of all ramen sites, the Supleks Database, has dozens of ways to sort through the best three of any category.  Their's is based on scientific formulas; statistics gathered from hundreds of reviews.  Mine is a bit less formal.  Word of mouth, most of the time.  Which is why I had to make it to Ranchu.I have often said that Shichisai, in the northwestern burb of Nerima, has the absolute best chashu in the city.  A few friends, independent of each other, both told me that Shichisai should come in with a respectable silver.  The gold going to Ranchu.Without a doubt I ordered the nikusoba.Before we get to the pork, the rest of this bowl is spectacular.  Most people ordered it with an extra helping of menma, as theirs is great.  Something about this bowl felt... special.  Maybe it was the suburban location, maybe it was the odd hours that are kept.  A must-eat for anyone out on the west side.And the pork.  From the picture, you can judge how rich and meaty it was.  Definitely on the podium, but I still like Shichisai's a bit more.  They are a bit more delicate and tender.  Ranchu is more robust, and a lot larger.  Why not try them both?  If you are on a bicycle, you could ride between the two in less than a half hour.View Larger Map東京都杉並区堀ノ内2-13-13Tokyo, Suginami-ku, Horinouchi 2-13-13Closest station: HonanchoOpen 12:00-14:00, 18:00-21:00Saturdays 12:00-15:00Closed Sundays and holidays  ",

A few of these shops keep strange business hours, and this was actually the 3rd or 4th time I had been by Cique.  The other times were either an unannounced holiday or the soup had run out.  Popular shops tend to do that.  It's all part of the adventure.Shio is the most popular of 2 choices here, though I went with the shoyu.  In keeping with the strange business hours, the shop serves only shio on Tuesdays, and only at night.  Take note.The roasted tomato topping is an excellent choice, and almost every customer ordered it.  A drizzle of pan drippings gives the soup a smoky, fruity flavor that intensifies as you reach the bottom.  Refined, cafe style ramen.The interior is classy, with mood music and a dedicated monitor showing beautiful scenes of nature.Another hit on the west side.View Larger Map東京都杉並区阿佐谷南3-10-8Tokyo, Suginami-ku, Asagayaminami 3-10-8CLosest station: AsagayaOpen Tuesday 18:00-22:00 (only shio)W, Th, F 11:30-14:00, 18:00-20:00Weekends 11:30-17:00Closed Mondays  ",

This is a typical Tuesday in Tokyo.Where is everyone?  What time is it?Ah, almost 2am, that would explain it.  In America, the bars close at 2, and there is a vibrant food culture at that hour.  In Japan, the bars stay open until whenever, but the trains stop at around midnight.  So the drunken eats are usually done closer to home, further from the place of alcohol.  Shimo is close enough for me to call home, so a bowl was in order.Kashira is your normal bowl of Kyushu tonkotsu (if I remember).  The kakuni topping was great (if I remember).The shoyu version was heavy on the garlic (if I remember).I don't always bring my camera when I go out late.  I will try to remember it more in the future.  Because a lot of bowls simply get forgotten in the wee hours.View Larger Map東京都世田谷区北沢2-16-6Tokyo, Setagaya-ku, Kitazawa 2-16-6Closest station: Shimo-KitazawaOpen 11:00-4:00am  ",

        "post": " Here's a quick breakdown of our first month of having a column in the popular Weekly Playboy magazine.  Available everywhere in Japan.Week 0Basically an introduction of Abram and myself.  We talk a bit about our past in the ramen world, and what inspires us to be maniacs about ramen food culture in Japan.The cover features actress Ayase Haruka.  Other things in the issue?  Micro 4/3 camera reviews, cosplay tips, and some retro guravia photography.Week 1We get into it a little about our philosophies of food.  Shops with a huge line aren't always the greatest, and simply being on TV can be enough to propel a bowl of ramen into stardom.  We promise to give honest opinions!Actress Aragaki Yui graces the cover.  Inside: compact cars, a mushroom buying guide, and more AKB48 than you know what to do with.Week 2Now we start to get into some of our favorite shops in Tokyo.  This issue is all about shoyu.  Abram gives nods to En, Dokkan, and Ranchu.  I go with Futaba, Nishio, and Shichisai.  We also argue about chashu.  I still think Shichisai is the best in town, even though Abram (and the writer Kei) disagree.AKB overload!  Also a Korean bar guide, girls in bikinis eating ice cream, and tips for erectile dysfunctional.Week 3This time, we talk about miso ramen, but the conversation goes more into our memories of times past in Japan.  There aren't a lot of amazing miso bowls in Tokyo, but the ones that shine are great.  Abram disagrees with my choice of Kururi, but we both agree that Oyaji out in Machida is amazing.Sasaki Nozomi on the front.  A lot of discussion about world finance in the issue.  Good to know that Japan can save itself by taxing pachinko parlors.See you next month!  ",

        "post": "  長崎お土産        My High School students took their annual field trip to Nagasaki last week.  Omiyage, the obligatory gifts that you need to bring back, was a given.  Expecting a couple rice crackers, I begged my girls for ramen.  And sure enough, 2 of my 4 classes brought me back some Nagasaki ramen.  Champon to be exact.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!        But how to make it?  I don't actually own a stove yet at my new apartment.        Hey Keizo, help me out!        Walking into a ramen shop and asking them to cook a bowl that you bought somewhere else is a definite no-no.  That being said, Keizo and the Bassanova crew hooked it up.        Nice smell!        Itadakimasu!    It was a bit salty, and the fact that there is corn in it makes it strange... but it's the thought that counts.   It's actually the first time I've had champon from what I can remember.  A strange type of ramen for sure.  bits of seafood and vegetables are wok fried, then the soup and noodles are added together.  It's almost more of a soup yakisoba than a ramen.    Thanks again!  How about some reaction videos:    Brian!      Sarah!      Keizo!      Wow, we should invest in some acting lessons before we continue down this road.        We had to try the secret Bassanova menu.  If you read Go Ramen, you'll see a lot of this.  The secret back fat is a great addition to the ramen.  Nice work!        And the secret pork bowl was rad.  Secret sauce!        Congrats Boom.         ",

        "post": " 麺屋神のしずくThe ラーメンアメリカ人 crew was at it again, checking out more noodle spots in Kabukicho.  This time was to the relatively new Kaminoshizuku.  Drops of the gods!  Way to set the bar high.Being Kabukicho, you need to be open late.  Kaminoshizuku raises the bar and is open from 11am until 9am.  Yeah, a mere 2 hours of down time to clean up and get ready for the next day.  Keep that in mind.Keep that in mind because I have, in my younger days, been stuck in Shinjuku after the last train of the night has left the station.  Countryside dwellers need to be on the 11:30pm express, or else it's time for an all-nighter.  A realxing ramen shop fits perfectly into the equation, and at Kaminoshizuku you can get a nice table in the back.  A nice table complete with privacy curtain and... chandelier?On this point, this shop is amazing.  So relaxing and comfortable.The counter seating out front proudly displays the ingredients in the soup.  What can you recognize?The menu isn't just ramen.  Plenty of alcohol and snacks are available.  Of course, we tried as much as we could.The gyoza were normal.  Your choice of Aomori prefecture garlic or Kagoshima prefecture pork.The fried squid was excellent.And then the ramen.  There are an absolute ton of options.  The best looking (from the plastic models displayed out front) was the spicy toributa.  Made from a blend of pork and chicken bones, this one definitely had the look of tasty.  But, to me, it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked, and laden with oil.  Too bad!The standard shoyu ramen was the best of the bunch.  Made with the past in mind, it is smooth and has a lot of flavors going on.  You saw all the ingredients, here is where you see what they can do.Then there were the outliers.  The menu shows off a few curious choices.  The milk and cheese tsukemen and the Napoli style tsukemen were 2 that caught my eye.  Well, eye, how is it?The Napoli style was , as expected, a tomato based soup.  Mixed with a chicken broth and some sort of meat sauce, the smell was fantastic.  But when the noodles were dipped, a definite under-performer.  Taking a soup spoon, I tried the dipping sauce alone, sans noodles.  It was great.  The soup alone is like something you would get at a nice soup restaurant.  The noodles are a complete mis-match here.  If I could change it, I would go with a thin noodle, and cover those noodles with powdered parmesean cheese (fresh-grated would be great, but unrealistic). The noodles would catch the soup a bit easier that way.  But maybe that wouldn't fit in with the \"Napoli\" image.Despite the disappointing ramen, this place is one that I will keep in the back of my mind, for the next time that last train goes whizzing off and a need a place to sit down for a spell.Official Site HereView Larger Map東京都新宿区歌舞伎町1-27-5Tokyo, Shinjuku-ku, Kabukicho 1-27-5Closest station: ShinjukuOpen 11:00am-9:00am (!!)

We collect toys, load up our bikes with said toys, and ride from Tokyo to orphanages in the surrounding area.  The idea of a \"Toy Run\" is very common around the world.  But for some reason, it never happened in Japan.  We set about to change that, and had a very successful 2009 event, with about 80 riders showing up.  In 2010, that number almost doubled.  We also did a lot more, like collecting money from organizations in order to buy some much needed things for the kids, like shoes and a bench for the orphanage.  We are hoping that 2011 will be even larger!You can see some pictures from the 2009 event here and the 2010 event here.If you would like to make a donation to our event, please click the paypal link below.

Roppongi is one of the worst neighborhoods for good ramen.  The expat community here, wealthy bankers mostly, tend not to wait in lines for cheap eats.  A reservation for 2 at Pierre Gagnaire... sure.  A ramen shop... not so much.  This leads to Roppongi ramen that caters to the other side of the expat community, drunks.Maybe you can read between the lines, I despise Roppongi.But the latest crop of ramen magazines seem to be Roppongi-centric.  One recommended rookie was near the famous crosswalk, as was I.The latest Menya Musashi.If anything, these shops are gorgeous.  The attention to detail is everywhere.  Kosho, the tiger's roar, means tiger motif.  While you wait for your ramen, go ahead and see how many you can spot.Dark walls, flawless steel, and dynamic lighting all add to the relaxing atmosphere.Not the best in it's class, but satisfying.  I always feel like something is lacking at the Menya Musashi shops.On the other side though, there is always some point that stands out, something great, at these shops.  Here, the pork is deep.At 1000 yen, it's a bit spendy.  Who would I recommend this shop to?  Anyone in the vicinity, as it may be the best bowl in central Roppongi.Official Site HereView Larger Map東京都港区六本木4-12-6Tokyo, Minato-ku, Roppongi 4-12-6Closest station: RoppongiOpen 11:00-22:00  ",

Classy burger joints are a theme in this part of Tokyo, as are all manner of chic eateries.Nakamuraya is the renowned ramen shop from Ebina.  Sometime last year they teamed up, and the result is one of the most popular shops in the area.A burger?!?  What is the meaning of this!That's better.  The shio is dusted with yuzu peel.  Great stuff, very fitting of the atmosphere.Speaking of atmosphere, this shop's second floor is a bit of a book cafe.  What sort of reading is appropriate?Irony never tasted so good.Dr. Atkins approves!

I went with the No. 1 choice, tantanmen.I've been searching, albeit lazily, for a great tantanmen shop in Tokyo.  A few were good, but so far nothing is remarkable.  It may be necessary to start going to expensive Southern Chinese hotel restaurants to find it.  Not quite there yet though.  Maybe next year.Totally normal.

        "post": " ソラノイロ japanese soup noodle free        Soranoiro, which probably means the color of the sky, is a recent winner of a whole stack of awards.  November is ramen magazine month in Japan, for some reason.  Ramen no Hon, Sugoi Ramen, Kami Ramen, and Ramen Walker, to name a few.  It seems like the names behind all of these magazines get together and crown a few winners the following month.        Soranoiro took home accolades in a few categories.  Their shoyu based chukasoba was lauded as excellent.  As usual, I tried the more interesting menu item, a vegetable based bowl.  You can read all about the differences here:        To sum it up, the chukasoba is standard, using very high quality ingredients.  The veggie, on the other hand, gets all crazy.  The noodles use paprika to give a bright orange hue.  And the soup is pureed with a few things, though the carrot was the dominant taste.  Subtle undertones of scallop and salt are there, but really the carrot is what you will taste.        Expect a wait.  And with over 50% of the menu being lighter, healthy choices, expect an even ratio of men to women.          Someone let me know how the standard shoyu is!      Check out my video review!

        "post": "  Ones Ones        Just around the corner from a shop I had on my list, named Bori, happens to be a shop with some minnor buzz about it.  The only reason I wanted to go to Bori was because they have a Bob's Big Boy out front.  It doesn't take much to get me to a shop.  But the appeal of actual good ramen was stronger.        The shop's recommendation is their slightly expensive niku yasai tsukemen.  Meat and vegetables.  Vagueness is a common theme on these ticket machines.        The noodles are made on-site.        And here you have it.  A fairly standard tsukemen.  The stand out feature was a spicy undertone.  Nice lunch!        But there's more!  A separate plate, piled high with meat and vegetables.  Unfortunately, in the ramen dictionary, vegetables means nothing more than bean sprouts and cabbage.  But the masses of meat made it special.        But there's more!  The flame grilled hunk of pork is great.  Full would be an understatement.  Stuffed would be going too far.        But there's more!  The chef brought over a bowl of what looked like salsa.  A bit more spice, and a taste of home (San Francisco Mexican food).        But there's more.  Soup added along with with rice to make what was described as risotto.  More like rice-in-soup.  Along with the noodles and plate of veggie-meat madness, this would be meal #3.        Great taste.  By this time, the added spicy salsa, bits of leftover meat, and vinegar makes a nice 3rd meal.  Seriously, this was a lot of food.        But there's more.  About halfway down, the chef came by once again and spooned in some sort of chili.  The ramen chef interfering with our lunch 3 or 4 times was unexpected, and welcome.        Get the smallest size though.  Seriously.

I mean, the menu, the photos on the walls, it all points towards drinking and eating pieces of grilled fish.  The grill, though, was definitely off at noon on a Tokyo weekday.        Because it's shrimp!        This inviting little shop does what some other place do (Zoot comes to mind) and serves ramen for lunch.  Being a seafood joint, the ramen has shrimp in it.  How much shrimp?        Tons.  There are 2 pieces of *yawn* normal shrimp, mounds of both sakura ebi and some kind of brown shrimp fry, and a couple excellent shrimp wontons.  Of course, the soup is flavored with shrimp.  Digging a little deeper, the soup is actually made with Malaysian Belacan, a spicy blend of fermented krill.  This is one unique bowl!        And at only 500 yen, an amazing value.  I went with some optional toppings, as recommended by the staff.  The cheese is unnecessary, as there is too much going on in the bowl already.  The curry powder, on the other hand is good... if you like curry.  Once again, a lot is going on in this bowl.        The vibe is great, and I'll be coming here for dinner sometime.

Reek, reek, it rhymes with good eats.  There is a lot of draw in that sweet smell.The menu is on the large side, with a shrimp miso and a shrimp tomato tsukemen being the top sellers.If the aroma of the shop wasn't a dead giveaway, the taste sure is.  Pure shrimp goodness.  Artfully topped with a dollop of pesto and sliced baguette, this is another bowl that is trying to break into new territory.  And with one of the recent ramen magazines declaring 2012 as the year of shrimp ramen, Gonokamiseisakujo is poised to be one of the top shops in town.  Or maybe it's just a fad.

But in Japanese, the phrase goes 七転び八起き.  8th time's a charm.  Whether or not this was my 8th time to Metoki, I can't be certain.  Definitely more than 3.There was the time that NHK wanted to film me eating here.  No go.  Just about everyone who I eat ramen with on a regular basis in Tokyo has met me in Tokyo's Korea town, Okubo, and walked past the massive lines of countless yakiniku and K-pop music shops, only to be witness to another failed attempt.But the truth of the matter, the shop's master has been getting on in years, and undisclosed health concerns have forced him to take random days off from work.Hearing through the grapevine that the shop would probably be open again gave me the motivation to try one last time.This is Tokyo ramen.  The light taste of niboshi, much less than other shops in the same category.  A massive handful of menma.  And a lot of noodles.By the way, the regular size is simply massive.  I could tell that a few other customers (petit ladies as well as large dudes) regretted that decision.  Be warned, unless you are training for the next sumo grand tournament, go with the small size.View Larger Map東京都新宿区大久保2-29-8Tokyo, Shinjuku-ku, Okubo 2-29-8Closest station: Shin-OkuboOpen 11:00-14:30Closed Sundays and Mondays  ",

Tokyo Ramen of the Year. I like this magazine.  It's not so great as a guidebook, but it gives a nice insight into which shops are making waves.  Matador sits on the podium for both their shoyu and their originality.The 贅沢焼牛らぁ麺 (luxirious roast beef ramen) is as good as it looks.  Giant slabs of roast beef, local green onion, extremely high grade shoyu and mirin; I usually feel that 1000 yen for a bowl is too high, but in this case it's almost too low.Since the soup is made from nontraditional beef bones, expect a much sweeter bowl here than your average.No word on whether any real matadors were employed in the creation of this bowl.View Larger Map東京都足立区千住東2-4-17 中村ビル1FTokyo, Adachi-ku, Senjuazuma 2-4-17Closest station: Kita-SenjuOpen 11:30-14:30, 18:00-soup runs outWeekends 11:30-soup runs outClosed Mondays  ",

I admit, it is worth a try, but I am shocked that it has gained such a following.  A better question would be, why am I back here?  For their monthly special.  Yeah, the shop that only does pineapple juice infused soup, with pineapple toppings and pineapple soaked eggs, has an interesting way to get you coming back.No, not the pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-point card, though that's a nice touch.No, not the pineapple beer (which they were out of by the way).It's this.  Strawberry ramen.  Their monthly limited edition fruit ramen.  Yes, I said limited edition fruit ramen.  Next month will be something new.Is this something that would send you straight to the to-to-to-to-toilet? At first taste, it kind of was.  The smell of strawberry puree in a light shio broth was just as you would imagine.  Go ahead, dump a jar of jam into your chicken soup.  As smell gives the strongest influence on taste, the first taste was a bit off as well.But then something magical happened.  The raw onion began to soften, and the little bit of cheese hidden under that red strawberry topping began to melt.  The unexpected combination . . . was actually good.Definitely an IMHO though.  I finished every last drop, but don't expect anyone else to.Next month's limited edition fruit ramen?  I asked.  He answered.Ba-ba-ba-ba-banana.The original review of Papapapapine can be found here.

Judging by the recent trends in ramen, advancements in the instant stuff, and a newly opened ramen museum in Yokohama, this humble food is finally going to get popular!Looking at the recommended shops within walking distance of my apartment (circa 2004), Furaikyo looked to be the best that I hadn't slurped yet.  It was also the only one I hadn't slurped yet, but that is besides the point.  The tonkotsu-shio blend looked positively warming, and the recent temperature in Tokyo required hot food.The spicy version had a lot of Korean flavors in it.  Peppy, but nothing to cause any sort of capsaicin-induced pain.

The Tokyo branch in Takadanobaba is definitely popular, so why don't I remember eating here?  Even the interior gave off a deja-vu vibe for me.Certainly enough of the ramen elite have been here.  The shop has been a mainstay for years, a bit of the north all the way down here in Tokyo.But I just don't remember.  And after this bowl at lunch today, I have a feeling that once again, the memory will disappear.  The first sip is good, but after that, I struggled with the second one.  The little flavors, the hint of sweetness and ginger, it's gone in a second and replaced by a simple struggle to eat.I could swear I remember eating here, and I could swear enjoying it.  Maybe I read it on someone else's blog.  I remember more about what I drank last night than the bowl I just ate.Though that was one of the best makoris I've had in Japan.  I can taste it now, the milky-white drink, foaming up with live cultures.  Amazing.Turns out I did sample the ramen of Junren in the past.  I guess I went to the Tachikawa branch, and labeled it as Jyunren, almost 4 years ago.

Usually the reason for celebration is that I've been here before, multiple times, but never had a bowl.  69 'n' Roll One falls under the category of ramen shops that are so lauded that they can afford to take random days off whenever they please.  So it took me 3 separate treks out to Machida, on the border of Tokyo, to actually try this bowl.        We gotta explain the name.  69 'n' Roll One?  Sound it out in Japanese and it's ro-ku-n-roll-one.  Let's roku!        The ingredients here are the absolute cream of the crop.  Iberico pork, premium soy sauce, and oil rendered from Akita chickens.  Yes, the ramen here is way up at the top.        The interior is built like a 50's diner. Some rockabilly paraphernalia here and there, a long counter, and the chef.  Junichi Shimazaki is famed for his fashion sense as much as his ramen.  Donning a punch-perm and cheetah-print shirt, he silently oversees what has been consistently ranked as the best in Tokyo.        Yes, I said silent. The place is totally silent. Even the staff of 3, including Shimazaki-san, communicate in muted whispers.  This is no fluke, it is well known that the shop is a silent place of ramen refuge, where a ringing cell phone is equal to a death sentence.  You might get away with a mumbled word or 2, but I wouldn't chance it.    Feeling very reserved, even a little frightened, I didn't take any photos inside.  But if you want to see the master, check out the recent Lucky Peach magazine for a comical drawing.              So here is this shop, where you feast on the finest ramen in utter silence, raising the experience to an almost surreal level.  You are intensely focused, and every bit, every smell and taste, is an almost religious experience.    Is what I would love to say.  But the silent treatment is totally unnecessary.  Or is it?  I think it would be better if it was more.  Shimazaki-san is stern, that's for sure, but he doesn't seem like a bad guy.  I want to see the full on Soup Nazi treatment.  People kicked out for taking too long at the ticket machine, cell phones grabbed and thrown out the door when they make the *click* sound after taking a photo, tears as a young man chooses ramen over his girlfriend.         Worth the trek for a ramen junkie.       View Larger Map   東京都町田市原町田3-1-4 町田ターミナルプラザ2F Tokyo, Machida-shi, Haramachida 3-1-4 Closest station: Machida  Open 11:00-17:00         ",

        "post": "  The Ramen Americans weekly column is going strong.  As always, each week we pick a theme and talk about it.  As always, you can grab a copy at your local bookstore, convenience store, or anywhere fine magazines are sold (in Japan!).Cover-girl of the week is Watanabe Miyu, with promises of a solo photo-shoot inside.  You'll also find articles about asbestos disposal in the disaster area and a cardigan buyers guide.  Did you forget how random this magazine is?Our article this week talks about some tonkotsu gyokai tsukemen shops we like.  Our main idea is that most shops of this style are very similar, and it doesn't take much to be simply \"good\". Something extra is needed to make an impact.  We both love Fuunji, hands down.The cover is graced by 21 year old Nakamura Miu.  As you can guess, it's not a work-safe photo spread.  Inside the mag are articles about the pirate Blackbeard, and a write-up about Japanese sake that is popular overseas.  Wow, a whole page on my favorite sake brewer, Masuichi!  This is in no way a sake expert's site, but I highly recommend their Hekiiken.  A dry brew that always gets compliments.The article talks Abram's recent trip to Osaka to be on a morning show there.  And, yes, I know our weekly English comment is less than correct grammatically.Kashiwagi Yuki, you can't leave the house in Japan without seeing her and her fellow AKB48 members these days.  There is a nice lesson on Chinese in this issue, with some useful phrases like このミカンマークではなく、アップルのiPhone4Sをください.  We talk about Abram's Kansai trip in more detail this time.  Tokyo is king, but there are some really interesting looking spots out west. Oshima Yuko.  Didn't think you could learn about so many AKB48 girls on a ramen website?  Think again!  Also there is a photo-shoot where cute girls recreate キン肉マン fight moves. Don't believe the hype!  There are quite a few shops in Tokyo that are hyped beyond belief.  We lay the smack down kinnikuman style.  Sapporo Junrei?  Go back to Hokkaido.  Ichiran?  Never.  What about Jiro?  We are split on that one, but you won't see any reviews of that artery clogging spot here!See you next time!  ",

        "post": " らーめん紬麦What happened to Akihabara?  A veritable wasteland for ramen in the past, suddenly it seems like every shop I hit there is a winner.  The otaku, with their voracious appetite for cute girls in high school uniforms (2-D of course), as well as an equal appetite for grease and carbs . . . could they be developing a taste for variety?  Finding Tsumugi was tough.  Be sure to go out the Showa-dori exit (昭和通り口) and you will be headed in the right direction.  Akihabara is shiny and confusing.  I spent a few minutes on the wrong side, until a nice girl in a maid outfit pointed me in the right direction.The shop is in a basement of a bank building, by the way.Tsumugi's best point are the noodles.  さぬきの夢, the dream of Sanuki, can be seen throughout the shop.  Turns out that those excellent noodles are 100% Sanuki flour.Sanuki, referring to the old name of Kagawa Prefecture, is home to some of the best wheat in Japan.  The relatively mild climate along the Seto inland sea is ideal for the production, and the local cuisine reflects this.  Of course, 99.9% of Sanuki flour goes into making Sanuki udon.If you have never had really good udon from Shikoku, you are missing out.The rest of the bowl works for me.  You have 3 choices, the shoyu, the shio, and the tsumugi.  The tsumugi is a bit on the sweet and spicy side.  Sweet from the abundance of sliced spring onion, and spicy from the addition of both spicy rayu and flavorful sesame oil.  Needless to say, there are a lot of flavors for the noodles to grab on to.Official Site HereView Larger Map東京都千代田区神田平河町1番地 第三東ビル地下1FTokyo, Chioda-ku, Kanda Hirakawacho 1, Mitsui Bank Building BasementClosest station: AkihabaraOpen 11:30-14:15, 18:00-20:00Saturday 11:30-16:00Closed Sundays and on the 2nd and 4th Saturday of the month  ",

        "post": " 麺創研かなで 紅Yes, this ramen shop is hot.  Hot in the spicy sense, and hot in the good-and-popular sense.The gorgeous wood paneling is a bit out of place in the not-so-gorgeous alley.  You'll likely pass a few other ramen shops on the way; dingy places that match better with the surroundings.  Kurenai is open late, so you really have no excuse to visit the others.Three types of miso ramen are on the menu.  The standard is a 3-star red bowl.  Drop down to the 1-star if you fear heat.  Jump up to 5 if you love it.  Apparently I love it.You might think that something is wrong with your noodles.  Big ones mixed with thin ones.  Mixed with even bigger ones.  And smaller ones.  It's downright confusing.The homemade noodles come in 7 sizes.  In what would often be considered a noodle no-no, all these sizes are thrown together in the pot.  The result is a bit firm and a bit soft with every bite.The heat of the 鬼紅, devil red, was intense.  As expected, I received a warning when handing in the ticket.  I also received some laughs as I drank 2 pitchers of water throughout the meal.  But I finished every last noodle, every last bit of meat, every last vegetable.Of which there was a lot.  Kurenai prides itself on a massive volume of meat and vegetables (cabbage mostly).  A menu option of double meat and double vegetables will yield a bowl with over half a kilo of toppings.As an afterthought, the devil red was a bit much for me.  The spices are choice, high-quality peppers, and the simple red, sans the devil, would be just enough to enjoy the balance.  Go for the double meat and vegetables as well, you only live once.Official Site HereView Larger Map東京都府中市宮町1-12-9Tokyo, Fuchu-shi, Miyacho 1-12-9Closest station: FuchuOpen 11:30-25:00  ",

What's up with that?  I remember a trip a few years ago to Jiraigen, a solid shoyu with too much chicken oil in the soup for my tastes.        Turns out they closed up shop, moved a mile away, and extended their hours.  Saikoro is Jiraigen, down to the rich broth and chicken oil.        The atmosphere is great.  Dubbed Japanese \"soul\" noodles, reminiscent of a 50's diner, playing loud hip-hop on the stereo, and featuring lock-haired young locals, this is a nabe pot full of modern culture.  With excellent noodles.        If I didn't dislike chicken oil, I would be a regular here.  That stuff just seems to coat my stomach.  Two out of three people would disagree with me on this point.  That's why I can reluctantly add this to my ever-growing list of recommendations.        Two out of three ramen fans would drink the bowl dry of soup.  Maybe more like nine out of ten.

A bright-yellow egg.  A chicken meatball, crunchy and rough with cartilage.The first whiff is accented by white truffle oil.  I would be happy stopping there; a simple shio with a little something extra.  But 2 kinds of jikasei oil are a draw here.When the bowl is halfway down, go ahead and add some coffee oil for even more flavors.

Closed until March 2nd.  Tanakashoten, I'll be back.  This shop was just a stone's throw from 環七道, the massive loop road that encircles the capital.  Expect a minor Ramen Riders event in the coming days.Fail!  I haven't actually tried any of the MacDonald Big American series #4 burgers, but they seem like a fail.  Grand Canyon burger, Las Vegas burger, Broadway burger, Beverley Hills burger . . . would you?This is more like it!  After the hour and a half spent riding obscure trains, asking for directions, and walking, I just grabbed a local Chiba ramen magazine and picked the one that was near the station.  Teppen turned out to be a winner.A typical tonkotsu gyokai soup, thick with umami, and piled high with grated onion.  Grated thin, the bits of raw vegetable simply melted into the soup.  Apologies to the children's English class I had soon after.  I hope my breath mints did the trick. Mt.

Why?Even though this shop has been popular with print media for quite a while, it strikes me as a bit of a gimmick.  One Two Three makes a ramen that is more like a soba.  Or maybe a soba that is more like a ramen.The noodles are mixed with buckwheat flour, and the soup is a simple 和風 style meant to resemble the stuff you get out in a countryside sobaya.  Those countryside sobayas, little family run shops that have been grinding buckwheat for centuries, are, dare I say, a more important part of Japanese culinary history than ramen.But ramen is welcoming. In its world, there is room for everyone.  Pizza ramen, come on in.  Pineapple, still going strong well after the initial rush has worn away.  But soba-ramen?

Though we can all agree that a thick tonkotsu-shoyu soup is ambrosia, the nectar of the gods, we might not be able to agree on which god is slurping away up in his (or her) kingdom.If you look at my ancestry, it's a Jewish gd.  If you look at my recent travels, I am a devout Buddhist.  If you look at the hip hop on my iPod, I associate with Muslims.  I've chanted with cults, sang gospel in churches, and been audited by Scientology.  This stuff fascinates me, and when I have the time, I will listen to people's religious spiel.I ran into a group of 20 year old Mormons on their mission out on the Seibu line.  Japan . . . not a bad place to be stuck for 2 years! Land of soy sauce and Mothra.  They seized the chance to tell me more about their passion, and I took the chance to do the same.  And that is how Elder Prince, Elder Zamarripa, Elder Reynolds, and I ended up at Inosho.Inosho has a fairly famous shop in Shakujikoen.  Their spicy tsukemen has been ranked on the short-list of Tokyo's hottest.  I was completely unprepared for the Inosho in Nerima.Jiro-kei?  It would appear that way.  I'm not the biggest fan of the garlic-ladden, male-sided Jiro style, but I'm in the clear minority.  Inosho's stand-out difference was the atmosphere.  Relaxed and friendly.Get the ベジ topping.  It's a bowl of cabbage and bean sprouts and extra that you dump in your ramen for a kick.  The extra in question comes in 4 varieties.  The ジロベジ was suggested by the staff.  You can probably guess what comes with that.As the name jiro-vegi suggests, it's garlic, garlic, garlic.The spicy topping needs less of an explanation.The tomato-vegi topping looked popular with the ladies.Definitely an intense bowl, as all jiro-kei bowls are.Thanks guys!

Don't expect a line, or even another customer for that matter.  But the mixed wontonmen, with a few pork wontons and a few shrimp wontons, is great.  It's Tokyo-style, meaning a niboshi-shoyu soup.

Case in point, a recent video from Keizo, aka Go Ramen, aka the manager at one of the best ramen shops in Tokyo, Bassanova.Actually, I am fairly in tune with my health.  Go back 6 years and I was a 270 pound, Taco Bell eating, Mountian Dew drinking fat man.  The story of my diet success is long, but the end result is that now I sit at around 180, and have never felt better.  I watch what I eat, and was curious how ramen soup correlated to my high-ish blood pressure.For the next month . . . no soup.  Eat the noodles, spare the broth.  It wasn't easy, but I did it.  From 130/76 to 123/69.  There you go.  A month of no ramen soup and I dropped 5%.  Was it worth it?  Not really.  Was it a truly scientific health study?  No way.I'm off for a bit of an adventure in America for the remainder of March.  Will said adventure include ramen?  Seeing as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York are all in the cards, it is a likely possibility.  Stay tuned.  I will post some mini updates over at the Ramen Adventure facebook page, so head on over and click the いいね！ button already!Speaking of facebook, I've got a contest over there.  Leave a comment on or like the contest post to be entered.  Good luck!  ",

Kuromon is in my neighborhood of Shinjuku, and I had passed the shop a few hundred times before.  Unfortunately for Kuromon, it lies just off the main drag of ramen shops on Shinjuku's skyscraper side; too far for a random hungry walker to stumble in to by accident.  Also, it is close enough to Nagi Nicai for a seasoned eater to avoid it all together.  But like I said, I had my camera with me.The 200g 麻辛丸 looked like the one for me. 麻辛丸 doesn't have much meaning, unless you sound it out.  Ma-Shin-Gan.This semi-automatic comes at you from a few angles.  First, the soup is meant to knock you down with spice.  More of a tang, this bullet was a dud.Trying to flank you, the 200g of pork is a heavy hitter.Wow.  This much meat at a place without a crowd can be a bad thing.  Being stuck with a quarter kilo of tough, dry pork is something I have done a few times in the past.  Not keen to do it again.Luckily, the pork here was excellent.  Nowhere present in any best-of lists, but tender enough, once dipped in the soup, to be thoroughly enjoyed.  The tangy, the fatty, the smoky; not bad.But like I said, this shop is in the middle of a major ramen zone, and there are many tastier offerings.View Larger Map東京都新宿区西新宿7-10-12Tokyo, Shinjuku-ku, Nishi-Shinjuku 7-10-12Closest station: ShinjukuOpen 11:30-15:30, 17:15-24:00Sunday 11:30-20:00  ",

Don't expect wisps of kodawari flavors to come through anytime soon.  But in the search for gourmet ramen, where rare and novel ingredients push the latest shop to the top of the list, it can be easy to forget what is so good about a simple bowl of noodles.  The original purpose of that soup that has become so important was to keep the noodles hot.  A little salty and fatty for flavor, in no way meant to come near the star of the bowl.  The noodles are what sustain you.  And the noodles here are cheap, irregularly shaped, and perfect.View Larger Map東京都荒川区西日暮里2-18-2Tokyo, Arakawa-ku, Nishinippori 2-18-2Closest station: NipporiOpen 11:00-23:30  ",

On the flight over, I discovered that the Japanese guidebook I had purchased was aimed squarely at a mid-20s female audience.  I wasn't about to spend my week eating cupcakes and shopping for hair accessories.  Kampai!  I'm thankful that my New York friends know the important things in life.Beer and ramen.  The beer is obviously imported, but what about the ramen?Totto takes an odd approach, choosing to do a 鳥人丸鶏白湯ラーメン, a creamy chicken bone paitan, that would be considered rare even in Tokyo.  Their sister shop in NY, Hide-Chan, does a creamy tonkotsu, so maybe that's the reason.  And cross-town rival Ippudo is obviously doing the creamy soup thing.  Take note, America, the top three shops in the battleground that is New York are all going for that ultra-richness that you can only get from boiling bones for days.In a strange reversal of the norm, this time the toppings were mediocre and the soup was on point.  The miso is unnecessary, opt for the spicy instead.House-made rayu and that white soup, this is a bowl that was worth the hour long wait.  Go for the extra hot version if you like your food spicy rather than bold.The staff all shouted Japanese greetings, the wait was done on the street, and the bowl had a cute little graphic below the soup line.  It's all coming together.Official Site HereView Larger MapCheck site for hours.  ",

        "post": " What is local California ramen?  Do you try and recreate something traditional from Japan, or do you opt for a different style using more accessible ingredients?I sat down with Chef Noriyuki Sugie, aka Iron Nori, to hear his approach to making ramen in the Golden State.Chef Nori, a classically trained French chef from Ibaraki, Japan, knows soup.  And the best soup comes from the best ingredients, obviously.  It's this simple logic that took his ramen away from the traditional pork and chicken stock, opting for beef.  California has some of the best cows in the world, happy cows come from California and all that, so why not capitalize on that.This is a superb lunch, though I'm sure the majority of ramen enthusiasts would be quick to comment.  The topping choices, oxtail or cheek or tongue, are about as unique as the umami foam on top.  The recommended oxtail is the clear winner, and our window-side seat drew some looks.  One passerby even went so far as to ask me for the left-over bone, for his dog I presume.  If you are averse to dealings with the Mission crowd, maybe a counter seat would be better.The ramen, though only $10 a bowl at lunchtime, failed to draw a crowd on a weekday.  This may be due to the shop itself, a cavernous old diner that is a little daunting to enter.  Be brave, you won't be disappointed.At night, Nombe turns into more of an 居酒屋(izakaya), with emphasis on the 酒(sake).  Owner Gil Payne took a moment to show me the dictionary-sized sake list.  Impressive to say the least.  Frequent tasting and pairing events seem to be going on here regularly, do check that out if you have a chance.  Even if you prefer your 酒 served hot and dropped into a cold beer, you might just learn something about Japan's national drink.Official Site HereChef Noriyuki Sugie's Site HereView Larger MapCheck site for hours  ",

        "post": " When two of the faces behind Ken Ken Ramen visited me in Tokyo a few years ago, they were nothing more than a once a week popup running out of a Mexican restaurant on it's day off.  Popup food is big in American cities these days, with the likes of food trucks and once-in-a-blue-moon chefs relying on twitter to drive their ventures.  It's fun, but I can imagine the frustration people feel when they get that tweet and rush down to the spot, only to see a two hour line and a sign saying that the goal of their journey is out of food for the day.This was a problem for Ken Ken in the past, and the first review returned from a Google search was a scathing one from someone who was turned away on multiple occasions.  There was no mention of the actual food.Jump ahead a bit, and they have established a permanent residence in the Mission.With an excellent bar.  This is another trend that ramen shops in America are jumping on.  If your shops is expecting to have massive wait times, why not build a bar for those thirsty customers.  Ken Ken's bar has Asahi on tap, a few choices of nihonshu, and boba tea from The Boba Guys.  This is one concept that Japan could learn from.  How about a cold beer while you wait?  Or maybe some hot Japanese sake during the winter.  Japan has no open alcohol container laws, and street-side drinking is almost encouraged here.I sampled the miso ramen, as well as the shoyu ramen.  Don't expect the bold, oily, heavy impact flavors that are all the rage in Tokyo these days.  Instead, Ken Ken goes for a more approachable bowl, mixing just enough red and white miso with their pork broth to let the flavors come through.It's good to have good eggs, something I never thought American ramen shops would figure out.  The toppings here are all on par.  Pork lovers should go for the double chashu.  Veggie lovers should go for the vegan version . . . I guess.  It looked pretty good, with a colorful piece of Japanese pumpkin on top.The atmosphere of Ken Ken is a major draw.  The place is noisy, hip, and happy.  Communal seating works in this situation.Ramen chef Hori-san is constantly evolving their product.  It's a tough battle, fighting against the varying palates of the citizens of San Francisco.  I remember taking these guys to Kikanbo, in Tokyo, a few years ago, and their reactions.  No, not their reactions, but the anticipated reactions of their American customers: Too oily!  Too hot!  Not hot enough!  I'm having an MSG induced seizure!The balance is working, and the biggest complaint from a modern day Google search? Only open four days a week. I brought my niece and her friend with me on my foray to Ken Ken. Yeah, I'm the rad uncle in the family.  Opinions of mazui boba tea do not reflect the views of this site's writer.  Opinions of oishi ramen do.Official Site HereView Larger MapCheck their site for hours  ",

        "post": "     I was admittedly excited when I heard about \"Sean\" Nakamura's latest Los Angeles experiment.  I say experiment, because this guy churns out ramen concepts faster than a kaedama of barikata noodles get's cooked.  There is, of course, the main shop in Ebina, some collaborations with hip cafes closer to central Tokyo, some sort of $100 a person fine-dining-ramen-themed spot called essence (closed?), a ramen-on-wheels food truck (closed?) . . . and that's just in Japan.  Some time ago, the ramen master started doing business in California, and the gastronomical experiment Ramen California (closed?) was opened.  The latest (not yet closed) foray is a tsukemen place right in the middle of Hollywood.        Sorry, it's not tsukemen, it's dip ramen.  Because you dip it.        In a trend that seems to have hit every successful ramen shop in America, the menu offers half a dozen or so appetizers.  While the standard side dish to Japanese ramen has forever been gyoza in Japan, expect American ramen to be flanked by pork buns, takoyaki, and some fried chicken.        I asked about the most popular tsukemen, sorry, dip ramen on the menu, and the mayu-laced zebra narrowly beat out the tomato-topped Johnny Dip.        Ennui.    Why, oh why did the master of subtle flavors decide on tsukemen.  Tsukemen is not just noodles separate from the soup.  At least it shouldn't be.  All the best tsukemen shops in Japan, the ones I drag friends to, the ones with hour long waits, the soup is an intense shock to the system.  Insanely thick, reeking of flavors that are sitting on the fence between \"just right\" and \"too much\".  But we were talking about IKEMEN, and I digress.        Don't get me wrong, there are subtle wafu flavors, accents of niboshi and umami meats; flavors that are well suited to a refined bowl of ramen.  I think Nakamura's famed yuzu citrus accented shio ramen would have found a nice home in Los Angeles.  But then again, the average person might just compare it to chicken soup and move on.  Judging by the general reception that IKEMEN has received in the past few months, their formula is working well.      And if a respected food lover came to me and said, \"IKEMEN is in the top three of Los Angeles,\" I wouldn't argue, it probably is.  I'm just glad to live in Tokyo.

        "post": " I was a little unsure how to approach a ramen adventure in my old home of Los Angeles.  The city has an established ramen scene, with pockets of Japanese enclaves dotting the area.  But time was limited.  I'd rather reconnect with old friends at a leisurely craft beer bar than a hectic ramen shop.  Sure, the facebook page yielded a lot of recommendations, like Yamadaya and Sinsengumi, and I wish I had more time (and a car!).The two that I was most interested in, newly opened IKEMEN and Tsujita LA, will be mentioned in due time.So how did I end up at Asahi Ramen?  Did I consult the internet?  Yelp tends to like this place.  Yelp also tends to judge ramen shops solely on wait time and whether they take credit cards.  Thirty minute wait and cash only! Zero stars! Did I consult the real experts?  Keizo from GO RAMEN! finds that just uttering the shop's name is a waste of oxygen.  The Rameniac's review isn't any better; \"dry, stiff chashu, pre-boiled non-marinated eggs, and a healthy sprinkling of ugh.\"The simple reason was that my cousin wanted to take me here.  How bad could it be?This is how I left the bowl after one sip of soup and one slurp of noodles.  My first bowl of ramen in America wasn't just a let-down, it was a shock to the system.  The lack of taste, any taste, and words escape me.  How do you review a bowl of piping-hot dishwater?  At least it was hot.Yes, critically renowned Tsujita LA is less than 100 meters away from here.  You should probably go there.Apparently, this place used to be good, but they flipped ownership a few times in recent years.Strangest official site ever hereView Larger MapWait, Tsujita LA?  To be honest, I didn't really want to go there.  I've heard nothing but positive reviews.  Praise upon praise for the masterful noodles; noodles made just the way they are made at Tsujita's shop in Tokyo.  And that's why I didn't go.  Should I spend a precious meal just so I can confirm what everyone else already said?  Not this time around.  Also, I emailed Tsujita-san before the trip, asking if I could come in for an interview, but he never wrote me back.  ",

        "post": " I'll be honest, whenever I visit my Dad in Hilo, Hawaii, the last thing on my mind is noodles.  Hawaii for me means picking a couple fruit off the tree, mixing up some fresh poke, and kicking back with Koa, the roadside-bought pit bull that runs things at our house there.  Local Hawaiian comfort food, like loco-moco, kalua pork, and saimin need to wait a few days.  It sounds strange coming from someone who drinks rendered pork broth on a regular basis, but I take a bit of time to adjust back to American style eating.Ken's is a regular place for said American food.  The menu is full of good eats, ono grinds in local speak, and no trip to Hilo would be complete without a breakfast here.But this isn't Breakfast Adventures, it's Ramen Adventures.  And in Hawaii, it's all about saimin.The won ton topped saimin from Ken's.Don't be fooled, just as Chinese lamein isn't ramen, neither is saimin.  The general idea is soft noodles in a simple broth.  Take this, and go crazy with the toppings.  Fried egg, skewers of meats, even slabs of spam are all acceptable.The soup, a subtle shrimp broth, reminds me of late-night bowls in Hong Kong.  Other than that, I wasn't into this saimin at all.  The noodles are, as wikipedia says they should be, all kinds of soft.  Borderline soggy.  Unacceptable by ramen standards; but we're not in ramen-land anymore, are we.The won tons are filled with teriyaki chicken.  Ah, teriyaki, because savory Asian cuisine isn't sweet enough for the American palate.  The charsu pork topping was definately of Chinese descent.  There were bits of fried egg, a fish cake, and a skewer of more teriyaki.  At least there wasn't any spam.Order the \"sumo size\" and they will signal your double-size meal's arrival with a clash of a gong.  Good luck with that.My advice?  The keiki min (child-size version of the saimin) split among your party is a good place to start your saimin adventure.Despite my off-putting first-time experience with saimin, I still love this diner.  I genuinely miss American diner breakfast; omelets, hash browns, and bacon drenched in hot sauce.  But this isn't Breakfast Adventures, so I'll move it on.Official Site HereView Larger MapAlways Open  ",

Fujimidai is a bit off-center though, and the one day a week that I am out there is this shop's day off, according to the internet.  Curse these Wednesdays!But the internet is not to be trusted!  They open at 11:30am on Wednesdays.  Perfect to grab a quick bowl before my lesson at noonMenjo Kyoshi is full on Chinese.  Despite the sign for tantanmen, they have an extensive menu of other dishes.  Things like spicy stir fried beef, lobster with sweet chili sauce, and king crab fried rice will have to wait until another day.The tantanmen is fantastic, having a bit more one-dimensional heat than Japanese-run tantanmen spots, which tend to break the spice with some sort of creamy.  Menjo Kyoshi bills itself as Chinese home cooking, using more expensive ingredients and unique methods from the home country to single itself out.  The worker's Cantonese chatting from the kitchen is a nice touch.The anindofu is a solid block of texture and flavor.  If you go for this, and you probably should, skip throwing a bowl of rice into the left over tantanmen soup.  That was a lot of food.Speaking of a lot of food, they have a 3000 yen course menu, including what looked like about 8 or 9 dishes.Official Site HereView Larger Map東京都練馬区貫井3-16-11Tokyo, Nerima-ku, Nukui 3-16-11Closest station: FujimidaiOpen 11:30-15:00, 17:00-23:30  ",

Often, it is just meant to draw the right crowd, like Shinjuku's Drunkard Alley.  Other times, it is a tribute to a location, like Daitabashi's Okinawa Road.Obviously there are some Okinawan restaurants there.世界の龍ちゃんよしき坊, aka Seikai no Ryuchan Yoshikibo, aka The World's Math Equation Monk Ryu-chan (?), from now on referred to simple as Jake-san's place, is a local hangout of Keizo from GoRamen.  The place is eclectic to say the least.  The counter in the above poorly-shot photo is actually a salt water aquarium.  Look for Nemo in there.And behind the counter?A secret pull-out piano.  Jake-san wasn't in the mood to play a tune, but he conveniently had a video of one of his TV appearances ready to show.More randomness, Jake-san races souped-up Corvettes on the side.A full selection of Okinawan beer is available.  The Goya brew was the winner.How's the ramen?  Apparently, \"It's  a  Bomb !\"Honest ramen.

No chance of failure this time!(the sign is from our first foray into the wild depths of Nakano)Arakaze is a production of Hototogisu in Hatagaya, another winning shop on the West Side.  The bar was set high for this one.The bowls here are all made with beef bones and beef toppings.  If it reminds you of the recent best-of shop Matador, that's because it is quite similar.  Matador-light if you will.An excellent bowl, and much closer than far-off Kita Senju, but it doesn't shine quite like the beef at Matador.There was, apparently, a beef ramen boom a few years back.  This might have only been one magazine's attempt at scooping the competition, though.  Regardless, it looks like the trend was called well before it hit.The called-trends for this year have been along the lines of super-thick with massive amounts of meat topping.

If you like heavy pork soup with ground pork and sliced pork toppings, you'll dig the ramen. That mound of pork mixes with the soup.  The kanshoku (ritualistic draining of every last drop of soup) is logistically tough here - spoon required.Most shops with crazy interiors, or unique architecture, tend to fall on the yum side of the spectrum.

Running parallel to the 6 lane Koshukaido (that giant thoroughfare with an expressway above the thing), is a pleasant street with less of the bustle.  Just this last week, though, I found a street parallel to that one, aptly named 不動通 (idle street).  This lazy street is full of local-flavor shops, even a couple serving ramen.Yaguratei had been visited by a plethora of B-list celebs, most of whom only illicit an \"I saw that guy on TV once!\" response.  As for the ramen, it is a solid shinasoba, that other, slightly less politically correct term for chukasoba.  The pleasant aroma from the vegetable version makes it the winner here.There is a problem though.

        "post": " When Nate was still living in Tokyo a few years back, our frequent ramen outings would end not with the standard gochisosama, but with the rhetorical question, \"Another bowl?\"  It isn't something I do much anymore, two bowls of ramen in the span of an hour, but that old spark was still there, and we went for another bowl.You shouldn't have a problem getting a seat at Misoya, the place was practically empty on a Tuesday night.This shop is loosely related to the 麺場 group of shops in Japan, out of Chiba.  Though the name 蔵出し味噌, kuradashimiso, is on the sign, Misoya gets the point across.  Miso, miso, miso.  Three different forms of miso ramen; Hokkaido style, Nagoya style, and Kyoto style.  You have probably heard of Hokkaido style, the thick white stuff from Japan's northernmost island.  But you might not know about Nagoya or Kyoto style.  That makes two of us.I could wax on about local foods in Japan for pages upon pages, but I'll cut to the chase.  There is no such thing as Nagoya miso ramen.  However, take a brochure from the information desk at Nagoya station, a little inspiration from column A, top it with something from column B, add some noodles . . . Nagoya ramen.  The sweet, red miso is a Nagoya thing, as is the fried shrimp on top.  You could even nerd out and say that the bowl is reminiscent of the earthen pots used in the region.The Sapporo version is fairly true to it's roots, except for the addition of some fried potato on top.  Nothing to write home about, and this bowl kind of put the proverbial nail in the coffin on miso in America for me.Don't feel bad for the red, white, and blue, most miso ramen in Japan falls short of amazing as well.  Kuradashi Miso (miso straight from the warehouse?) gets the point across, and might be just enough for a satisfactory stateside miso slurp.Official Site HereView Larger Map  ",

        "post": " Many of Ramen Adventure's readers come from America.  So many should know about Momofuku and David Chang.  The uber-famous Korean-American bad-boy chef that blah blah blah, I'm not into that stuff really.  Go to the million other blogs that either worship Momofuku or scream and cry about how overrated he is.I'm here for the noodles.  Spoiler alert, they are overrated.But the rest of the menu is fantastic.I ventured in with none other than Ivan of Ivan Ramen and Nate of ramenate.com.Two of our group are New York natives.  Two of our group have direct connections to Momofuku (Nate wrote an excellent article for the Lucky Peach Issue #1 and Ivan graces the cover - his hands at least).  All three of us are certified ramen nuts.By the way, the following negative statements are solely the opinion of Ramen Adventures.This bowl is weak.  The soup follows a standard shoyu recipe, but substitutes the difficult-to-find dried katsuo flakes with smoked bacon.  The idea is to substitute one smoky meat for another.  It doesn't work.  I'm a big fan of the recent bacon everywhere campaign in American foods, but not here.  The Momofuku book goes into detail on this topic, and is actually convincing.  Until you taste it.   I think part of the reason is the restaurant's relationship with local farms.  The nearest katsuo factory is half a globe away, but excellent pork is just upstate.  Excellent pork that shines in the toppings.  The belly and shredded shoulder, as well as the half cooked egg, are the best I've experienced stateside.  Noodles ain't bad either.  Might work in a different soup.No one comes to Momofuku for a quick bowl.  The menu offers a dozen or so small plates.  Are these on par with the noodles?  Or are they up there with the toppings?Toppings.  The grilled octopus is drizzled with a sweet and spicy kimchi and orange foam.The fingerling potatoes are on a bed of miso, and topped with . . . katsou flakes!  I thought they couldn't get those!  Don't put too much thought into it.The cauliflower is kicked up just a touch with citrus and spice.  The cured duck salad is textural and aromatic.This is a theme at all the Momofuku restaurants; heavily modified eats that can be as tasty as they are confusing.  At the nearby Momofuku Saam Bar, I had cured ham with coffee mayo, apple kimchi, and raw beef minced with watermelon.  Off-topic food conversations could drag on at this rate.You could spend a lot of both time and money here.Budget enough time, a couple hours, to wait and eat, and budget enough cash to eat whatever you want.And if you go with a group, go ahead and just order one bowl of noodles.  Share it, check it off your list, and move on.Official Site HereView Larger MapCheck site for hours.  ",

Senrigan was a recommended shop from from a reader of the site.  Thanks are in order, this one was one of the better bowls (of Jiro-kei) I've had.You want garlic?It's the question that gets asked at every Jiro-kei shop (kei means style or type, Jiro is a popular family of ramen shops in the Tokyo area).  Have your quick response ready, or the busy staff will be on your case like bean sprouts on this bowl.Ninniku and karaage was my answer this time.  Garlic and spicy bits of fried batter drippings.  Also available is the Fuji-sized mountain of vegetables, mounds of pork fat, and spice.  Ask for them by name.  Mashi mashi if you're feeling bold.Not too intense, as can be the case at a shop like this.  The pork was tender and moist, another thing which I find isn't standard.I feel a bit under-qualified to review this style.  I haven't even been to the original Jiro shop in Tokyo.  And my reviews are always skewed based on what I did that day.  If I was being lazy, drinking and sitting around the apartment, Jiro doesn't work for me.  But if I exerted myself with a bit of exercise, this stuff goes down great.  On Senrigan's day, I had cycled about 40 kilometers out west and back for some work.  Famished, I devoured this bowl with ease.I should also note that after every bowl of this sort, this one included, my stomach felt like I had made a mistake within an hour.Twenty minute wait at nine pm on a weeknight.  I still think I'm the only person not obsessed with Jiro.I was touring a stateside ramen lover around, and couldn't let him go home without sampling this side of ramen in Tokyo.  Senrigan, or maybe Fujimaru or Tatsuya, will probably be part of any future ramen food tours that I do.  For the sake of the traveler.  Like I said, I'm the only person not obsessed with it.Facebook site hereView Larger Map東京都目黒区駒場4-6-8Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Komaba 4-6-8Closest station: HigashikitazawaOpen 11:30-14:30, 17:00-22:00Sundays 11:30-14:30, 17:00-21:00Closed Mondays  ",

        "post": " ラーメン凪 煮干王 西新宿1階店The Nagi on the first floor, below the Nagi on the second floor, has closed.  In it's place, another Nagi has opened.  Not a lot of fanfare around this one, with an upcoming Omiya Nagi shop in the works sitting in the spotlight, but I had to give it a try.  I like Nagi.  A lot.The niboshi ramen here is nice.Good stuff, nothing out of the ordinary.  Like I said, nice.One of the simplest menus around, the only three choices are shoyu, tokusei (all the toppings), and shio.  A three-button ticket machine would suffice, if it weren't for the different sizes.  When in doubt, just hit the upper left button.But then I saw the chef making something random.  Surely there was no fresh-grated pecorino cheese on my niboshi ramen.An as-yet-unreleased limited menu item, jumping on the beef bandwagon.Matsusaka (松坂) beef!  A quick breakdown of Japanese beef is in order.  Matsusaka sits up top with Kobe and Yonezawa.  All of these are just place names, the cattle are from the same breed of black wagyu.  But the fame comes from the strict way the cattle are raised, as well as attention to lineage.  The grain is very high quality, and yes, they are fed beer to stimulate appetite.Nagi went ahead and used a pure beef stock, topped with a slice of the highest quality beef I've ever had in ramen. The only time I have had a better piece of beef was when I paid a week's salary out in Kobe.  While cross-town Matador is probably the best and most refined bowl, this limited one at Nagi is a different beast all together.  Not so sweet, it's a blast of umami meat juice that will probably sell out before lunch.By the way, all that Kobe beef you hear about in America is a lie.  It's Japanese wagyu cross bred with angus, given average feed, and often kept completely sober.  Good stuff that makes excellent burgers, but nowhere near what we have in Japan.Official Site HereView Larger Map東京都新宿区西新宿7-13-7Tokyo, Shinjuku-ku, Nishi Shinjuku 7-13-7Closest station: ShinjukuOpen 11:00-23:00Closed on some Sundays  ",

Quite a feat for an overseas native, perhaps, but this number pales in comparison to some people I've met around town.  One such guy was at a recent one-day-only ramen collaboration.  A ramen-data encyclopedia who had visited in the thousands, I asked him for some recommendations near stations I would be working at in the coming month.  Stations far, far away.Hon-Atsugi station is about an hour west of Shinjuku.  I've been here a few times, but always remained seated as my train sped past.It may be far off, but good ramen can be found anywhere in Japan.Good ramen indeed.Shio is a tough nut to crack.  There is a reason noodles in clear chicken soup is reserved for cheap cans; the delicate flavors simply don't work when slurping.  At least, they don't work as well as something thicker in viscosity or stronger in taste.  But every so often, shio is done right.  The toppings usually stand out as top quality, the noodles are just right, and the aroma is unmistakably umami.One of the best in town.

Sure, a phone ringing at this ungodly hour is enough to break most friendships into pieces, but an hour later we were in line for ramen, drinking a cold beer.  What's so special?You see, this was no ordinary bowl.  A one day, limited collaboration by three of the hottest ramen names in recent ramen trends.To put it in perspective, I arrived over an hour and a half before the shop opened.  I was number nine in line.  By the time they opened, around 75 people were ready to eat.  Only 200 bowls would be served.  To say that my comrades in the early ramen-wait are fans is the understatement of the year; these people are nuts.  The chefs, humble as they are, are elevated to minor celebrities around these people.  I'm happy to be part of this crowd.Again, you may ask, what's so special?  A triple soup, every component using the best that Japan has to offer.  Pork from one of the best ranches in Hiroshima.  Kochin chicken from Nagoya, of course.  Fish - saba - from Chiba.  Collaborations are a common thing.  If you take a Pokemon attitude towards life - gotta catch em all - you'll probably never have time for a regular bowl.Miyazaki-san (Soranoiro) and staff from Saikoro (Saikoro) on the soup above.

A week or so after eating the wahaha, I was told that the gahaha is the one to try.  Regardless of ordering the lesser recommended of the two, wahaha was as great as expected.

Soup trivia, shop origins . . . nerd stuff.  I passed most questions, but one stumped me.  \"At what shop did TV personality David Ito do his training?\"  David who?David Ito (デビット伊東), nee Ito Tsutomu, has, like most minor celebs in Japan, acted in about a thousand dramas, starred in made-for-TV movies, and been on nightly variety shows by the boatload.  Sorry, that's all I know.  I watched some videos of his on Youtube, and was bored out of my skull within minutes.Using his notoriety, and a pitch to some TV show called とんねるずの生でダラダラいかせて, David decided to go into the ramen business.  And the answer to the former question?  He studied at famed Ippudo.  Whether he studied making ramen (years to master) or just business practices (much less time) is something I am not sure of.  His chain of shops, most in the west of Tokyo, now extends to Hong Kong and Macau; indicating the later.One of the shops is in the super-convenient Tachikawa NY Ramen Square.The style is a combination of Ippudo's Hakata style tonkotsu soup with some Tokyo flair.  If you can call silky mounds of pork back fat flair.  Which, of course, you can.It failed to impress, maybe the hype of eating something a famous person created was lost on me.

Seriously, this place was hyped.It might have had something to do with the slew of awards that this creation had been given.  The All Asia Gourmet Contest ABC Grandprix!  I have no idea what that means!  There was a B gourmet boom in recent years and awards are as common the often overrated shops that win them.But you gotta try it.  Restaurant floors in expensive department buildings tend to fall on the expensive side, and ramen shops tend to be quite rare.  They also tend to be of lower quality than their street-level equals.  Yeah, ramen in department stores tends to be a losing endeavor.  There are a few exceptions to the rule, would Toyama Black be among them?The \"black\" here is twofold.  First, of course, is the shoyu used.  A very high quality, very dark blend that turns the soup it's signature color.  The second is the special pepper on top.Unfortunately, it isn't very good.  Overly salty, and the pepper wasn't anything remarkable.  I'm no expert on pepper, but it wasn't freshly cracked, the easiest way to level up your quality.  They really should have done the \"Would you like fresh ground pepper\" routine, with staff doing the grinding at the table.  \"Say when!\"Official Site HereIf you, by some chance, have come to this site looking for information about Toyama, don't take this negative review to heart!  Toyama is a wonderful part of Japan that I have been to numerous times.  As for food, they have excellent seafood, drawing from the Japan Sea / East Sea / East Sea of Korea.  The same international issues that plague the naming of international geography lead to Toyama being multicultural and thriving.  Eat some fresh hotaruika (firefly squid) and masuzushi (pressed trout sushi), and maybe try Toyama ramen in it's natural habitat.View Larger Map東京都豊島区西池袋1-1-25 東武百貨店スパイス館12階レストランフロアTokyo, Toshima-ku, Nishi-Ikebukuro 1-1-25 (Tobu Department store 12th floor)Closest station: IkebukuroOpen 11:00-22:00  ",

I started thinking of a Plan B when the staff opened the door and announced that everything was in order.  Your ramen better make up for the undue stress that you caused!Stress? What stress?33 is a fantastic blend of all things chicken.  The soup is a light chicken-bone shio, simple and aromatic.  But then 33 goes crazy!  There is the obligatory egg, a chicken meatball, pork chashu, chicken chashu, and some greens.I've always said that shio ramen needs excellent toppings to stand out, and 33 doesn't disappoint on that.The master, like many others in his field, visited New York and now plan on opening a shop there.  Call it the Ippudo Effect.  How could you not see the nightclub-like scene and not dream of someday running one of those.Good luck.  The Ippudo Effect has influenced dozens of quality chefs here in Tokyo.  Hollywood only claimed one.  To the share of them, though, New York is the only place in America worthy of their gifts.  And with Ichiro taking up with the Yankees, the dreams are only going to get stronger.Official Site HereView Larger Map東京都千代田区神田神保町1-44Tokyo, Chioda-ku, Kanda-Jimbocho 1-44Closest station: JimbochoOpen 11:00-14:30, 17:00-24:00Weekends until 21:00  ",

If you head down to the Nihon TV building you can see what I am talking about.Fun . . .. . . and excitement.  Don't get distracted by Evangelion or bikini models (not pictured), there is free ramen to be had.Wait in line, I assume.  I attended a press day, so the wait was minimal.  I would expect a massive line during the summer months.Get your bowl.Slurp away!  The shop was very chic; all red and black.  The bowl was equally simple.  No toppings really, just a peppering of sliced green onion to go with the shoyu ramen.By the way, you are being streamed on the internet.Check it out here: http://nedannonai-ramen-ya.jp/Finally, write what you would pay for this bowl.  Completely hypothetical.  The 777 is a bit high, but I wanted to send some lucky vibes to whatever it is they are trying to do here.The big LED signage out front (all zeros on this, the negative first day of opening) will reflect the average, as well as how many people tried it.  For an update, check it out:Isn't technology cool!  Honestly, I would pay maybe 400 yen for this bowl.  Without any special toppings, it isn't worth a lot.I'd like to hear what others think of this.

        "post": " Mina Ramen FactoryThank you Michael Vito for this guest post.  Michael writes and shoots over at Like a Fish in Water, a site all about urban environments and their relationships with government and the private sector.  In Tokyo (and New York) the popular urban ramen shop is a wonderful thing, bringing thousands of people a great bowl.  Thanks for the guest post!Few would confuse this mostly residential block of 5th Street in New York’s East Village with any part of Osaka or Tokyo.  Yet whenever I feel nostalgic for the little comforts and pleasures of Japan, I seem to end up back here at Minca Ramen Factory. The unassuming storefront is easy to miss for first time visitors, though when the wind blows right the telltale stench of long simmered pork bones will lead the way.In 2004, Minca was born out of Chugoku transplant Shigeto Kamada’s long running, unrequited craving for authentic ramen in New York. Unlike Ippudo, Totto, Minca’s sister shop Kambi and a handful of other shops that have popped up in the intervening years, Minca eschews the sleek design and predictable Asian flourishes common of this market segment. The interior is cramped and ever so slightly grimy, with exposed brick walls and a few touches of chiguhagu (mismatched) decoration that would make Martha Stewart cringe. Despite this, or maybe it’s because of this, the atmosphere never comes off as anything other than causal, comfortable and friendly, with warm smiles from behind the bar looking out over the crowd of happy slurpers.Kamada-san’s flagship bowl is a blended tonkotsu and torigara stock, flavored withshoyu tare and purée of roasted garlic. When I first found Minca several years ago, they used thin, white and wire-hard Hakata-style noodles. In the last year or so there was a switch over to something a little thicker and more yellow (my hunch is higher kansui content), but still plenty toothy and springy. The soup is full-bodied, but not quite so viscous and hefty as an unadulterated tonkotsu, so I think the newer noodle suits it well. Thick, buttery slabs of chashu, negi, kikurage, menma, a seasoned hard-boiled egg and sheet of nori come standard.Minca also serves up crispy, juicy ebi gyoza.The bar seating offers a great view into the preparation area. As I had arrived just after opening, I caught large sheets of steeping kombu being rescued from the day’s first batch of dashi.Life is better with large, steaming vats of simmered pork and chicken bones.At just after opening, and with temperatures already approaching the realm of 90-100°F and humid, there wasn’t much of a crowd at Minca on this day. In the evenings and come cooler weather, you’ll be looking at a typical ramenya wait of 10-30 minutes, depending on queue length. Maybe I’ll see you there.Official Site HereView Larger Map536 East Fifth StreetNew York, NY, 10009Open everyday 12:00-23:30  ",

        "post": " らーめんと甘味処 九月堂The recent search for charming little ramen shops took me to the upscale shopping district north of Shibuya station.  Within a minute of this ramen shop, you will find a Ships, a Beams, a G Star Raw, and a Comme de concept shop.  I don't expect the average ramen slurper to know what those are (except the guys at Ken Ken in SF), but patterned shirts with bow ties sums it up fairly well. What I am getting at is that this is not your typical ramen neighborhood.  It is more of a craft beer bar followed by fancy crepes.  It takes a special kind of ramen to work here.Is the white leather couch too much?  Probably.  Anyways, ramen comes kotteri or asari.  Heavy or light.The light was quite nice.  Cafe style in every way, the light fish broth was accented by grated yuzu citrus.  A standard recipe for success.Too bad I got the kotteri.  It was a big miss.  Salty and pungent, I could only finish about half.  There were some temperature issues as well, the soup and some toppings felt cold.  Maybe it was a timing mistake with the ordering of both styles.  Regardless, do not order the kotteri!Nice place to relax though.  And thanks to the aforementioned bad ramen, I saved room for desert.Yuzu sorbet in a yuzu jelly.  Fantastic.  There are also some enormous parfaits that make this a proper date spot for someone looking to impress a lovely lady with something sweet . . . or a cool dude with some hot noodles (asari!)Official Site HereView Larger Map東京都渋谷区神南1-15-12Tokyo, Shibuya-ku, Jinnan 1-15-22Closest station: ShibuyaOpen 11:30-22:00Weekends 12:00-21:00Closed Mondays  ",

        "post": " らぁめん 一福I had been here before, back when the shop was hidden down a maze of back streets.  There were both stairs and a pedestrian tunnel involved in getting to this bowl.  This may be minutes from Shinjuku and its modern towers, but some of these back roads look like they belong in the 40s.  Crazy, it always felt like an adventure into the past.The new shop is a shiny place that is no problem to get to.  Still very much a local shop, visited by locals.  I will miss the old hard-to-find spot though.  There was something . . . special about it.The irorimen, iron fireplace ramen, is what to get.  A miso ramen in a technical sense, this bowl includes medicinal Japanese sake, crunchy shark cartilage, and other secret ingredients meant to promote health in a way that only medicinal foods can.The magic thing about this bowl is how the flavor develops.  The first sip is borderline boring, but it slowly gets creamier and more flavorful.  By the end, you'll have no problem draining the bowl.Official SiteView Larger Map東京都渋谷区本町2-17-14Tokyo, Shibuya-ku, Honmachi 2-17-14Closest station: HatsudaiOpen 11:30-14:00, 18:00-21:30Sunday 11:30-15:00Closed Mondays  ",

        "post": " 星火I have been on an adventure lately to find some オシャレ ramen shops.  Oshare (お洒落 for you kanji learners out there) means stylish, and it is the go-to adjective for restaurants with nice interiors.  In most cases, the interior matches the cuisine, and an oshare ramen shop will go the extra bit to make their food . . . pretty.Sure enough, in upscale Jiyugaoka, there are plenty of shops that look the part.  Seika is actually more of an izakaya, serving all sorts of bites to go with their long list of Japanese alcohol.  Ramen was one of a dozen lunch items.The summer-only tsukemen had a creamy-slash-spicy tantan thing going on.  What's that floating in the soup?A ponzu ice cube keeps the soup cool.  It should be worth noting that the ingredients used at Seika were top notch.The shio ramen is delightfully complex.  Three quail eggs, as opposed to one giant one from a chicken, is something I would like to see more of in ramen.  Or how about some quail eggs and a chicken egg.  Duck eggs, too.  Most ramen adventurers are fans of eggs.The lunch set included some fried lotus, a bit of a pickle salad, and a red riceball.  Classy.But, I'm sad to say, the noodles were strictly average.  With the impression of the shop, and all the great ingredients and care taken, I would really expect some high quality noodles.Another bad point for the ramen, yet a good point for the shop, was that the other lunch choices looked amazing.  Another customer ordered the rice bowl; raw salmon and scallops topped with a healthy pile of salmon roe.  A veritable Hokkaido-in-a-bowl, I left envious of their choice.To get there, walk past the doggy hair salon, turn at the vintage clothing shop with only three shirts for sale, and stop just before the house with six Ferraris.

I don't know the classification, but it is definitely good eating on the far east side of Tokyo.It's best said by the master himself, \"Ippongi taste, Hakata style.\"Ippongi has received a few awards in the past, and if it wasn't all the way out in Koiwa, I would have gone there sooner.  In reality, it is less than 20 minutes from Tokyo station.  It just feels far.Ie-kei - Yokohama style - has a lot of misses in Japan.  A standard feature of this style is choice.  You can choose the thickness of the soup, how much oil is added, and the firmness of the noodles.  I think this is a trick.  By offering so much choice, a bad bowl of ramen can be blamed on the customer, not the shop.Well, Ippongi doesn't offer a choice.  It just comes delicious.  The pork flavor is strong, with little aftertaste.  I was a little sad that they didn't have any of their custom nori seaweed sheets.  Some shops imprint white text onto the dark green sheets.  Some shops burn a little symbol on their egg.  Others have crazy one-of-a-kind bowls.

Though the namesake Kobe Beef has been used to make ramen, you are better off seeking your fix elsewhere.Though I consider ramen a total Japanese food, the Chinese roots mean that most Chinese restaurants serve the stuff.  It should be obvious that a Chinatown would be a good spot to search.  Kobe is one of the three major Chinatowns in Japan.  Yokohama and Nagasaki play host to the other two.  But San Franciscans be warned, the only thing Chinese about these so called towns is the generic font that the shops use.  Touristy to say the least.  But touristy can be good sometimes.Grab a seat.  The main square has a handful of street-side ramen shops, all with prices at about 300 yen.Simple, shark fin (probably fake) noodles.On the small side, but a good value for the novelty factor.  The ultra-thick soup is magma-hot.  Be careful.Oh, and get the frozen, shaved fruit cups.  The wait was like 20 minutes . . .. . . but this was rad!View Larger Map  ",

Intrigued.The shop is less of a ramen shop and more of a soups-that-match-with-rice shop.  You can technically throw noodles in any soup and call it ramen, a practice that is still common at Thai restaurants in the city.  A practice that is quite abominable! But you have to give a shop a chance.The toppings are eclectic.  Grilled chicken, melty cheese, mounds of mushrooms.  I went with the double veggies for 200 yen.Well, at first, the \"double\" veggies is a disappointment.  Is that just an extra pinch of lettuce?  It's a rhetorical question.The soup made up for that.  A solid, Thai-style curry.  Creamy and just a bit spicy.Didn't match well with noodles.  Once again, this was just a great bowl of soup with noodles thrown in.  Most menu items are available with either ramen noodles or some nice full-grain rice.  Go with the rice.The thick rice ice cream is fantastic.View Larger Map千葉県市川市市川1-26-10Chiba-ken, Ichikawa-shi, Ichikawa 1-26-10Closest station: IchikawaOpen 11:30-24:00  ",

        "post": " 田中商店Here it is . . . Tanaka Shoten.  This is perhaps the most famous shop in the greater Tokyo area for Nagahama-style tonkotsu ramen.  I say Tokyo area because, though it is technically within the city limits, this place is a trek to get to.  But more often than not, the trek can elevate a bowl from normal to extraordinary.  Tanaka Shoten is the perfect example.For me, from Shinjuku, it took about 30 minutes racing along on my motorcycle. By train it is much more of an endeavor.  From my station it is about an hour with five line changes on the way.  On the map, it is just off the 318, a road that circumnavigates the entire Tokyo area.  Check it out!Is Tanaka Shoten is the most revered Hakata-style tonkotsu ramen outside of Kyushu? It is as traditional as it gets, down to the open-late mentality.  Four in the morning is the last order.The shop is stinky, the line is long but quick, and the menu is small.Of course, I went with the standard.  Not that I had much choice.  I could have had it with more pork, or more green onion, or more of whatever topping I wanted.  All bowl come with the same soup and noodles, and that is what I was concerned with.The only outlying option here is the 赤オニ, red devil spice mix.  A tangy dollop of spiced ground pork.A good bowl, though the trek could either make or break your opinion of it.  If you travel solo far out of your way for this bowl, you will be disappointed.  But if you make an adventure out of it, this is a great bowl of destination ramen in Tokyo.Official Site HereView Larger Map東京都足立区一ツ家2-14-6Tokyo, Adachi-ku, Hitotsuya 2-14-6Closest station: RokuchoOpen 18:00-4:00am  ",

Growing up in California, I had ample access to a dozen or so varieties of dried and fresh chilis.  Pasella, pobleno, ancho . . . I learned how to cook with them all.  This is a great limited special, but don't expect much Mexican flair.  Japan is probably one of the least knowledgeable countries in the world when it comes to real Mexican cuisine.  Yahiko goes a step beyond the standard taco-taste, albeit a small step.  Corn, tomatoes, and some tortilla chips account for the Mexican toppings, and a chili spice mix is added to their always excellent curry soup.I would actually recommend their original curry tsukemen over this.  But if you want to do the whole summer limited thing, you won't be disappointed.Eleven secret spices?  Not a secret anymore!Yahiko's Info Here  ",

The menu includes random choices like clam ramen and spicy curry ramen, all at prices you would never find in a more central location.  650 yen is a steal of a deal these days!    We had a few people, so a sampling of choices was no problem.        The regular Rinsuzu ramen.        The spicy rayu ramen.        And the lemon ramen.    Unfortunately, the lemon overpowered the flavor of the two other bowls, so I can't really comment.     Fortunately, the lemon was the unexpected winner of the bunch.  Who would have known that a citrus overload could match well with a shoyu soup.  Well it does, though the strangeness makes this something I won't be making the trek out for on a regular basis.

        "post": " 我武者羅の夏限定Summer time is a time for ramen shops to let down their hair and do something different.  The limited edition (限定 - gentei) offerings can be anything really.  Strange flavors and unusual ingredients are the norm.  And if your shop is already successful, it doesn't really matter if your experiment is a hit or miss.Gamushara has a definite hit with this one.  Ume tsukemen.  The noodles are tossed with sour plum flavoring, the soup spiked with chopped up umeboshi (pickled plum), and the whole thing is accented with shiso.  These are all fairly dominant flavors, so a weaker soup makes the best match.  It is hard to say whether or not you should try this.  If you like umeboshi and shiso, the answer is yes.  If you don't, then it is a solid maybe.Awesome twist at the end.  Your left over soup becomes ochazuke, a rice dish of a hot tea soup poured over rice.  I finish a lot of meals in Japan with a small wasabi and umeboshi ochazuke, but this was a first at a ramen shop.On second thought those maybes should be upgraded to certainly.Gamushara's Info Here  ",

Along with staff from Playboy, we checked out a handful for an upcoming magazine feature.  I would say the theme this year is creativity.  These are all top shops in town, and though I can't recommend the limited offerings over their standard bowls, these are a lot of fun.    Gamushara does a miso wonton with super-secret-spicy-punch sauce.  Intense!    Soranoiro makes a thick corn potage soup, topped with crab.  Do you like corn?  Japan is a little corn-crazy, throwing it in anything deemed Western.  Corn on your pizza, corn in your spaghetti, chocolate covered corn.  Personally, I don't enjoy the stuff in any form aside from tortillas.    Basanova brings a Tex-Mex inspired chili bean tsukemen to the table.  The chashu is smoked by a friend who runs a nearby barbecue spot.  Definitely the highlight; I would like to see more smoked meats used as toppings.    Shono goes nuts with their gentei.  Actually, Shono is know for their monthly gentei being a completely off the wall artistic experiment.  This month's has - deep breath - shioyaki sanma (a type of fish), fried yam chips, ginger mousse, plum mousse, and an egg drop soup with a piece of smoked sanma inside.    The mad scientist himself.    Saikoro draws inspiration from his wife.  Dubbed LiL Mama Ratatouille Curry Tsukemen, the ratatouille is created by Mrs. Soul Noodles, the curry soup my Mr. Soul Noodles.    Mutahiro serves up the most \"normal\" gentei.  The shio niboshi soup is crisp, the Autumn toppings simple.  And the staff?    Fun shop.  The Autumn gentei special will be in Weekly Playboy on October 8th, check it out wherever finer Japanese magazines are sold if you have a chance.

Anything noodle related, you can be sure it is represented here.  There were half a dozen noodle manufacturers on site.  Most ramen shops in Japan use noodles that were made at a factory.  Don't let the word factory dissuade you; these are often very high quality.  Back in the USA we have a few of these noodle factories, and if you have a bowl in a major coastal city the chances that you are eating Sun Noodles or Yamachan are very high.Be careful at these industry events, or you will be loaded down with more samples than you can carry.  Variety is key in Japan.  Often a shop's secret recipe isn't such a mystery, but the careful selection of ingredients is what make it stand out.  Do you want niboshi from Chiba or niboshi from the Seto Sea?Miso from Hokkaido.Kitchen equipment.  This pressure cooker lets you make a 12 hour stock in about two.  You might need a second mortgage on your home to buy one though.  Very cool technology.  I had a chance to use this cooker in Osaka, which I will write about someday soon.Ticket machines with digital touch screens.  SUICA is charge card that is meant for use on the trains, but has since become a standard form of payment.  Choose your ramen, then just wave your wallet in front of the machine.  Slick!This expo isn't just for ramen.  And despite being called Noodle World, there are also sections for izakayas, hotel foods, and franchising.I tried to talk to as many ramen-related exhibitors as I could before heading out to non-ramen sections.  Can you guess why?  These expos are an easy place to get very, very drunk.Why buy US fries?  According to the info-graphic . . . we're #1!Whale anyone?When you start to spend some time talking with the black sesame fountain guy, maybe it is time to go.The next day, I made some nice mazemen with the noodle samples I got from Maru Yama Seimen.Yum!

Every year, famous shops from around the greater Tokyo area get together to serve up some tasty limited edition tsukemen dishes in a festival atmosphere.  Each week, for three weeks, eight of them show up and battle it out for the top spot.  I went and actually worked at it with Ivan Ramen a few years back:  http://www.ramenadventures.com/2009/11/big-tsukemen-festival.html   This year, the theme is a little different.  Instead of only popular shops from Kanto, they are bringing in people from all over the country.  Japan is known for regional flair in gastronomy, so this should be a tasty event indeed.  The participating shops all had to win their spots in a nation-wide vote.  To make it even more tasty, I will be working there again (hooray!) on Sunday, September 30th.

I really want to hate that place, due to the stupid rules, but their ramen was fantastic.Anyways, out of soup as usual.A nearby back-alley had a rather spicy looking shop.  Shinku's motto is, \"Spicy . . . but good.\"Sure, it was ok.  Just enough spice to kick up the oily, cheesy blob of noodles.The shop is known, I gathered, for their limited menu items.  Doing a monthly, or even bi-monthly gentei ramen is an easy way for a local shop to stay relevant.They've been in all the local magazines, though a lot of these are as useful as a phone book for finding choice ramen.Official Site HereView Larger Map東京都町田市原町田4-1-5Tokyo, Machida-shi, Haramachida 4-1-5Closest station: MachidaOpen 11:30-22:30  ",

At dinner, Ryutenmon is typical of ultra-gourmet Chinese restaurants; I'll have to get back to you about the $700 a person chef's course.If the limited hiyashichuka, cold noodles often eaten in summer, is any indicator, that course is going to be a random spattering of exotic ingredients.Fried ginko root, unagi, jellyfish, and a few kinds of baby tomatos.Edamame beans, stewed apricot, sliced ark shell, and choice beef flank.  All in a black vinegar sauce.  Very sweet and sour.I won't say it was worth it, because that is a lot of cash to drop on some noodles.  But it was definitely something special.  The noodles are handmade, of course, by Chef Chin.Tantanmen is available year round.  The limited hiyashichuka is not. I've seen these summer noodle specials at a few high-end hotel restaurants, and they usually last only the months of July and August.  See you next year!Official Site Here  ",

But like the Yokohama China-town, it has taken on an uber-touristy feel.  With the boom of K-pop fandom in Japan (I'm looking at you mid 30s to 50s Japanese housewives!) the place is a bit of a madhouse these days.  I'm talking fleets of tour buses at noon on a weekday.There are plenty of Korean staples.  Yakiniku, bibimbap, and chijimi shops along the whole block.  There are even a few places to get ramyeon, that Korean cousin of ramen.Most Korean noodle spots here use instant noodles.  Not interested.Apart from the kimchi, this isn't very Korean***.  True to the sign on the shop's door, this is Chinese with a Korean twist.  The noodles are hand made on site, lamein style.***I shouldn't make assumptions about Korea, since I know very little about noodle culture there.  According to a reader's comment, this combo is quite common in Korea, and is maybe the quintessential Korean-Chinese noodle dish.Probably the number one item on the menu is the double plate of jyajyamen and champon.  The champon is chock full of strange seafood bits.  Strange by a Western standard.  But, remember, this is Korean-style Chinese food in Japan.  That's a lot of east.And, they deliver.View Larger Map東京都新宿区歌舞伎町2-32-17Tokyo, Shinjuku-ku, Kabukicho 2-32-17Closest station: Shin-OkuboOpen 11:00-3:00am  ",

Maybe I heard the shop's name wrong, or maybe she doesn't know which shop is which, but the tencho here was confused as all when I tried talking to him about our mutual friend.Regardless, Hachi is in all the magazines, so I guess it is worth a try.It was a bit underwhelming.  Not a lot going on.Counter-top condiments to the rescue.  The shop has not one, but two secret blends for your seasoning needs.  The dry mix looks to have half a dozen or so spices to grind into your soup.  And the ceramic jar, it is a fishy tare sauce that adds some much needed depth to the ramen.I usually don't flavor my ramen too much, but here I doused it.

These nights often start with food at an izakaya or Chinese restaurant, move to a bar, and end with ramen.    Hanabi features a choice of either regular ol' chuka noodles or healthy konnyakumen, noodles made with konnyaku.  こんにゃく is translated as \"solidified jelly made from the rhizome of devil's tongue.\"  No wonder it isn't so popular in America.  It's good stuff, though, and you'll find it in all sorts of Japanese dishes.    Another option is the spice level.  Enter at your own risk.  Spice is healthy . . . right?    It is a good combination, and a little different from the norm.  Recommended for the spice-lover.    The konnyakumen are good, but definitely a one-and-done thing. A bit like a thick version of Vietnamese rice noodles, they have a firm texture.  Dubbed as a healthier choice, I suppose you could add these to your dieting regimen .  What else can you add?    Hmm, maybe not.  But if you visit Hanabi, get the とろとろ豚ナンコツ, slow-roasted pieces of pork cartilage.  Even if it isn't good for your weight, the collagen is supposedly great for your skin.  Fat, happy guy with smooth skin?  Or skinny, sad dude covered with blemishes?  A no-brainer!

Well, the search continues, and Mikan was the only Otsuka shop with a page in the massive 2012 Ramen Walker magazine.    I should start using the acronym YATG - Yet another tonkotsu gyokai.  Mikan is YATG.    Not that there is anything wrong with that.  There is a reason that so many of these shops are successful.  Creamy pork broth blended with smoky, bitter fish is a winning combination.    YATG that doesn't really stand out.  The one thing I did like was the sudachi tinted vinegar.  The sour citrus goes great on the chashu.  By the way, there is a yakitori shop nearby, named Soten, that is the best in Tokyo.  A little pricey, but if you are a foodie it is a can't miss.

But on the walk back to my motorcycle, a little old lady, just shy of 85 years old, stopped me on the street.        She was telling random strangers that the best ramen shop in town was just down the little alley to her right.  Who can argue with little old ladies!        I wanted to continue hanging out, so I invited her along.  Together, we slowly walked the 10 meters in 10 minutes and entered Ito.        As local as it gets.  The place was old, dirty, and empty.  The menu? A stained piece of paper pinned up on the wall.        The tencho fit in perfectly.  Slightly egotistical, he proceeded to tell me which shops in town have horrible ramen, and which shops have horrible staff.  I won't share, but a couple dudes who run ramen shops in Kitakata are apparently すごくダメ.    \"What makes your soup so special?\" I asked.         It is the niboshi.  The dried fish are common in Kitakata ramen, but not at this level.  Cooking with niboshi is tough, but if done right it is great for an after-drinks meal.    According to the master, even the foreigners love his ramen.  A group of English teachers living in Shiokawa, the next town over, make a weekly trip to Kitakata for sushi, drinking, and Ito's ramen.        Yeah, this was perfect post-drink ramen.  I should also note that the place wasn't really up to code in cleanliness, and I found a little bug in my ramen.  Not a big deal for me, but I could see that being a big problem for someone used to the spotless, fashionable ramen shops of the big city.

It is down a small alley, sandwiched between a couple other recommended ramen shops, and very welcoming.        The all-old-lady staff seemed very happy that I could read the menu, which is quite extensive for a Kitakata ramen shop.  The summer limited ramen, a creamy sesame based chilled dish looked inviting, but I went with the standard.  The previous two bowls I had had in this town were just so-so.  So?        The best of the bunch.  By far.  Shanhai's soup is made with pork bones, which is standard here in town, with an added bonus of an overload of vegetables.  You can really taste it.  Refreshing.        This was the only bowl that I drank to the bottom.  The all-old-lady staff was pleased to say the least, and I could hear their giggles as I walked out into the summer heat.

Fair, but I was on a motorcycle, so the sake sampling was out.  I went to the brewery anyways.        And our sake talks soon turned to ramen talks.  The sake master suggested Bannai.  I bought a bottle of karakuchi for later, and rode straight there straight away.        Definitely the longest line in town.  Thirty minutes on a weekday afternoon.        Something I've never seen, the staff was handing out sun umbrellas.  Kitakata is surprisingly hot, in the mid 30s, while the nearby mountains are about 10 degrees cooler.        I feel sorry for the neighbor shop.  Living in a shadow all these years.         The line continued inside.  At this point, I grabbed a pamphlet, and it all became clear.  This is the same Bannai that has locations all over Japan.      I never went, as they are strictly a chain operation here in Tokyo.  Not interested.  I might have skipped Bannai in Kitakata if I had realized it before I was already inside the shop.   Yes, it is a mass-produced, money-making operation.  But everything has a birthplace, and the honten here in Kitakata keeps it all original.  Locals assured me that the two are very different.           If you have walked by one of their many operations, you have seen this image.  Enough pork to cover everything.  At 900 yen (both the chain price and the original shop price) it is a steal for that much pork.        Notice I didn't say, \"That much good pork.\"  This bowl was a complete let down.  No depth, just a basic bowl.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt, but left with a disappointing taste.        Looks like there is one a few minutes from my home in Tokyo.  I won't be going.

You see, I was recounting my horrid tale of lackluster eats, and the sympathetic ear didn't want my rare trip to their hometown to be in vain. Seirokaku, a much tastier bowl of cold Korean noodles in their opinion, was a logical destination.    Fool me once, shame on you, Morioka.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Granted that the fruit topping here, a pear, was better than Pyonpyonsha's apple, and the teeny piece of meat floating somewhere in that soup was nice.

These three countries can get along just fine!  For once, the English translation was great.  I asked who wrote it, but that is a mystery for the ages.  To sum up this entire page of text is easy.  Mix it up, eat 90%, crack in a raw egg, mix it up, get some soup added, finish.    Cucumber, green onions, grated ginger, and that black miso that Korean jyajyamen is so known for.  Mix it up.    Leave a bit on the plate.    With the beaten egg and clear, hot soup.  All that for just over 400 yen.    This particular shop is just across the street from the old castle ruins, now a well-manicured park.  Both are highly recommended.

The reimen, on the other hand, is just plain boring.  On the few other occasions where I've had this dish, I have found more faults than good points.  The soup is too bland, the noodles too chewy, the hard-boiled egg too hard-boiled.  Pyonpyonsha was just another bowl of this stuff.

        "post": " 岩手の盛岡    Welcome to Morioka, far north in Iwate prefecture.    Morioka, a rather uncommon tourist destination, is known for not one, but three different noodle dishes.  わんこそば - Wanko soba 盛岡冷麺 - Morioka Reimen 盛岡じゃじゃ麺 - Morioka Jyajyamen     Reimen is a Korean noodle dish, served cold, that usually follows a hearty meal of Korean barbecue.  The Morioka version adds some seasonal fruit, often apples or watermelon.    Jyajyamen is another Korean dish (adopted from the Chinese one of the same name) that tops rough-cut noodles with a giant dollop of black miso spice mix.  I'm not sure why the Korean theme here.  The local history has nothing to do with Korea, and Morioka isn't too close to the sea that connects the two countries.    Don't miss your train around here.  I arrived just as it was leaving.  Less than one an hour.  Plan accordingly.    Oh, yeah, the wanko soba.    While reimen and jyajyamen could be classified in the ramen category, soba is definitely not in there.  But I gotta mention it.  I mean, there is a wankosoba cartoon printed on the side of the high speed bullet train.  This is the noodle dish that everyone knows.    The concept is simple.  The serving lady dumps one bite of soba noodles into your bowl.  Just one.  The second you finish, she is there with another. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. It's a sort of all-you-can-eat soba noodle event.    This was my first time trying this.  It was a little strange at first, but by the 40th or 50th bowl, I was a noodle slurping machine, deftly slurping with one hand and receiving more noodles with the other.  The obvious question; How much can you eat?    The average male, the staff told me, eats 50.  Some advice: The waitress comes out with 15 at a time.  So take the minute break between gorging sessions to add some seasonings to your empty bowl.  There are a lot to choose from.  Nori, sesame, spicy sansho, grated daikon, etc.  Mix it up each time.  Another tip: You can't just quit.  You have to finish every last bit of noodle in your bowl and put a cover on it.  Sounds simple, but when you are looking like you are in pain, she will be hovering like a hawk.  Micro-seconds between the slurp and serve.  All I can say is . . . good luck.    How many bowls of wankosoba can a die hard noodle nerd eat?    95 . . . this time.  I tried to quit at about 90, but that waitress was relentless!  Oh, and 15 servings of the stuff comprise one regular bowl.  ",

The map may say Chiba, but like Tokyo, this prefecture is deceptively massive.  Head down the Boso peninsula and you'll see what I mean.     So we got in line.  The line grew.  By 11:30, there were at least 20 people.  But in a prefect example of the mob mentality of humans, no one had actually checked if the staff were inside prepping.  Just like Murphy would predict, the shop had decided to take the day off.  I blame the first few people in line.  But, in the end, the lack of smell or sounds from the shop should have been a give-away to all.    Back on our bikes, we raced to the nearest shop.  Countryside?  It took over 20 minutes on a sportsbike.  Countryside for sure.    Well, the fried rice and pork topping were top notch.  And the ramen?  チャーハンのほうがいい。      The tables all had lucky fortune machines.  Put in 100 yen, spin the wheel, and if your fortune says so, you win some gyoza.    I got the maximum good fortune, but no stamp for free gyoza.  What kind of luck is that!    I won't be back.

Pork stewed for hours in a mix of shoyu and more Okinawan liquor.  The most delectable, tender meat that ever touches ramen.

But Hokkaido puts five shops, each distinct of a different region, into one box. Very cool.    They were all decent. That is as far of a compliment that you will hear from Ramen Adventures. For only about 1000 yen, it makes for a good conversation starter.    As does the ramen pudding.    Yep, everything in that bowl is some sort of desert. Chocolate chashu. Caramel soup. Puff cream egg.  Cute.  ",

        "post": " にしかわ    Shizuoka city is just over an hour from Tokyo on the next bullet train. Don't go packing your bags just yet, there isn't a lot going on out here . . . or is there?    The first thing you should do when travelling to a new place is find out what the local food scene is all about.  Turns out Shizuoka is known for oden, skewers of fishcake and other goodies simmered in a distinctly Japanese broth. Just head down to one of the city's many oden streets, find an old-lady-run shop, and enjoy. Shizuoka has their own brand of the stuff, with a darker dashi than other cities.    If oden isn't your thing, check out this gelato shop. Nothing but local green tea ice cream. Seven levels of matcha!    Anyways, the ramen. The local issue of Shizuoka Ramen Walker (yes, every prefecture has one of these magazines) awarded only one shop in the city limits with a spot in the top 20. Shizuoka prefecture, like most non-Tokyo prefectures, might require a bit of a drive to find the best noodles.    Nishikawa delivers. All the parts of a good bowl are here, from the golden soup to the chewy noodles, to decent chashu on top. Open late to boot.    So pack your bags!  Shizuoka city is actually quite a gourmet destination. In one night, I was able to gorge myself on oden, sample some local gelato, drink at two of the many craft-beer bars, and top it off with some ramen. Check out the excellent English site Shizuoka Gourmet for a ton of info.

But despite my finishing the dregs of this bowl, my previous overreaction was severely balanced by the under-performance of this bowl.

        "post": " 麺屋 開高    I avoid airport ramen like the plague.  The best you can hope for is something from Ajisen, which isn't saying much.  That was my general opinion . . . until I went to Sapporo.  The New Chitose airport is a sight to see.     Hokkaido is mega-famous for local food.  Ramen sits alongside fresh seafood, dairy products, and regional specialties like gingisukan, a lamb dish named after Ghengis Khan.  The airport pays homage to it all, and you could easily spend four or five hours exploring and eating.  Much like the Ramen Republic at Sapporo's station, you'll find the Ramen Dojo here.  Same concept.  We picked a shop that had a wall of celebrity autograph plaques and not too much of a wait time.  Kaiko had the perfect balance.    The recommended, and limited, Tokachi Pork Noodles are the way to go.  Tokachi is an area of Hokkaido that is known for mega-tender pigs.  Maybe it is the cold winters.  Maybe it is the strict whey diet.    And the soup.  Those same local pig bones are cooked for hours and blended with either a white or a red miso blend.    This is what you want in miso ramen.  The creaminess of the pork bones and the saltiness of the miso, perfection.  The pork up top is just an added bonus.  After a lackluster bowl in central Sapporo, I'm very happy to leave on a full stomach.  I'll be back to Sapporo again sometime next year, hopefully with some more local ramen knowledge and a little more time.  なまらうまい！     View Larger Map  New Chitose Airport Terminal 3F  Open 10:30-8:30  ",

Well don't worry, the 10th floor of the main railway station houses the 札幌らーめん共和国, Sapporo Ramen Kyowakoku.  The Republic of Ramen?  Nice!  At the time of writing, you can choose from four Sapporo shops, and one from Hakodate, Asahikawa, Ebetsu, and Tokyo.    I picked Daishi simply because there was a fat kid stuffing his face.  I should have done my research!  Like I said, not a lot of time.    And the ramen?  How was this miso blend?    Meh.  Strictly average.  A little too oily, though that is a common theme with Sapporo ramen.  Even though I didn't have time to try it, Shirakabasanso (白樺山荘) looked like the winner of the group.  Next time!

Making thousands of dollars a week from ad referrals, selling books by the series, appearing on my own Food Network show.  Well, I sold me soul to the devil, that's how!  And now he's here to collect. (cue the creepy mood music)    Then I woke up.  My ad referral payments amount to about five bowls of ramen a year.  The book idea was crushed by some execs at the publisher.  And my presence on TV only occurs when a Japanese morning show wants a token white guy to slurp some noodles.  But at least the Satan part is coming true! (you still have that music cued?)    This newcomer is a winner.  Just look at these toppings.  Rare cuts of marinated pork, and perfectly broiled, tender chicken breast.    The soup is a rich niboshi-shoyu, though they have a shio on hand as well.  I heard through the ramen-vine that the shoyu is much better.    It is unknown why the 666 theme.  The shop's BGM isn't any kind of Norwegian death metal, and there's nothing on the walls aside from a poster of Rafaello's angels. Satan was an angel once.    If you really want to get down, go for the ニボガツ.  It's a serious kick in the pants of niboshi and garlic.

I didn't want to, especially since last year's event was only slightly better than the lame experience two years ago; where I waited in line for three hours and then had to leave empty stomached because I had somewhere to be.    But a recent stamp card rally requires a visit.  Isn't that reason enough to go?  By the way, all recent ramen reviews from Setagaya-ku are due to this stamp card.  I'm a sucker for these promotions!    How about the idols?  Maybe that is your thing?    Or the . . . pro wrestlers?    This is Yoshihiro Takayama, and by the sheer number of fans posing for photos, he must be quite well known.    His ramen, from the aptly named Stomach Hold, was downright miserable.  Tasted like beansprout water, if that is a thing.    Also on hand was Ryukishin, straight from England!  But wait, the shop is a chain in Osaka that opened a shop in London.  Do they get to flaunt that at the show?    Apparently they do.  Osaka-based blogger Friend's in Ramen describes it best; \"a solid and refreshing if not-very-exciting chicken shio bowl.\"     Then I watched an \"air ramen\" competition and decided to go home.  My two less than stellar bowls might have something to do with the line length.  I was all by myself, so I passed on the two hour lines for gyutan tantanmen from Sendai and Osaka Black, opting for medium sized lines instead.  These events are slightly bearable if you go with a group of ramen nuts.  Otherwise, skip them.  ",

        "post": " Chinese Tapas Renge    Be careful when you see a bowl in a magazine. Let me rephrase. Be careful if you see a bowl in a fashion magazine.    Sometime last year I picked up a copy of UOMO, a fashion magazine whose target audience is men in their 30s who have stylish handbags. I'm in my 30s, and I have a few stylish handbags, but the magazine had a nice feature about tantanmen shops in Tokyo that I was more interested in. Keep in mind that tantanmen is often served not at specialty noodle shops, but at your run-of-the-mill Chinese eatery as well. High-end Chinese spots also tend to serve up bowls.  There was no indication in the magazine of what category Renge fell into.    When I rolled in, solo, the staff looked at me like I was in the wrong place. Sure, the color of my skin and my uncommon height often do this in Japan, but this time it was the solo part. This is totally a date restaurant.  Bring a date, order some wine, and gorge on tasty Chinese-style tapas. Japan has a whole category of food that is akin to tapas; izakaya. For this reason, the concept of small plates served with the intent to drink isn't as magical as it felt back in America.  I ordered the XO ramen, the cheapest one on the menu at 1800 yen. The tantanmen was for some reason something like 3000 yen. There was also a Shanghai hairy crab ramen for just shy of 5000 yen. I was quietly informed that this is a tapas restaurant, and I need to first order some appetizers and drinks. The photo above is my five-piece set (the three-piece set is only for couples, I was also informed). Some olives, pickles, Shanghai sausage, chicken with house-blend spice, and fried wonton.    Then came the ramen. About half the size of a standard bowl, it was . . . refreshing. This XO sauce tinted pork topping added a nice layer on top of the consomme broth. Very basic, it definitely brought me back to the simplicity of noodles in Hong Kong. Noodles that cost about a dollar (in Hong Kong).  Which brings me to my conclusion. Though a nice, tasty snack, the bill of 4700 yen (over $50) for this was a bit too much.  I have a short list of high-end Chinese places that serve noodles, but I'll do my preparation in the future to avoid another surprise.

While the first, the Yamanote, just circles the metropolis in an endless loop, the Chuo heads out in a perfectly straight line deep into the heart of Japan. Don't fall asleep and miss your stop!    Mutahiro was making a bit too much good ramen. Is there such a thing? Not really, but if your shop makes two completely different types of bowls, a fishy niboshi and a simple chicken shio, why not expand? Why not have one shop for each. Mere blocks from each other.    So now, if you want niboshi, head out the south exit. If you want chicken, head out the north.    I've had the original chicken bowl before (it is great), but today was a special limited offering. Famous chicken and eggs from Oyama in Tottori Prefecture. Noodles made pasta-style. And a prize!    On this day only, customers got a Mutahiro sticker. Show it off on your cell phone, and in the future, your toppings are free. That's right, a VIP card.    In the future, you too can get a VIP sticker . . . if you get the lucky bowl. If the you finish the soup, you might see some lucky kanji at the bottom. Good luck!

Nearby Gonokamiseisakujo is one of my top shops.    Momonga's take is a winner. Thick soup, a touch of yuzu citrus, and plenty of dried sakura ebi for that extra shrimp kick.

When I heard that they opened a junk-style outlet, I put it on the short list of must-eats. But Kawagoe is a bit of a trek, about 40 minutes from Ikebukuro, and I'm not often out this way.    But today I was. Look at that bowl! I am a massive fan of Junk Garage, could this be on par? A sloppy mess of everything-good-ramen?    Not really. The key with junk-style isn't just fat. While Junk Garage ads texture (babystar) and spice (spicy shrimp mayo), Ganja just piles on the grease.  The one redeeming factor is the challenge factor. A group of high school boys, sat just down the counter from me, all ordered the big sized versions, and much trash talking followed as they slurped down the 4000 or so calories. The quickest of the lot was beaming with an alpha-male glow as he stumbled out ahead of his pals.    But unless you have something to prove, give this one a pass.

This was the final stop on a mega-食べ歩き night.    The key is that the kimchi and natto are blended with the soup, as opposed to being simple toppings.  I don't hate natto, but it isn't something I care for much in it's slimy, natural state. Blended with the soup, though, and all that remained was a slight essence of the stuff. A whiff of stinky, fermented soy beans if you will.    Yes, I will!    Wait, what's that on top?  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the rare cheese topping. It was odd for sure, and I don't know if I can recommend it. The sweetness of the local cheese, the stinky natto, the spicy kimchi, and the creamy miso. A lot going on.

A light shio, tinted with baby clams. The strainer full of clams was a definite first. Smart!    Sure, the shop is open for lunch, but they are also open well into the late hours of the night. Shijimi, those clams you just ate, are known as a hangover-prevention food. Smart!    Also on the menu was a maboroshi egg. The English speaking staff, a couple dictionaries, and I couldn't find a good translation for this word. Something along the lines of a dreamy illusion, so good it defies expectations. Totally true.

Very cool, about a hundred noodle lovers from the greater Tokyo area converging in Shibuya to drink and eat cake. Become a fan!  http://www.facebook.com/groups/tmc.fan/    You can imagine that we eventually made a decision to get our slurp on. But where? We had a group of about nine, and fitting into a ramen shop with that many is tough. Luckily Shibuya San Chome, on that ramen-heavy street out the South Exit of Shibuya Station, had us covered.    A vinegary su-men. Hmmmm . . .    A soupless mazemen made with thin Hakata noodles. Hmmmmm . . .    Ah, the standard stuff. Shibuya San Chome is a Hakata-style tonkotsu place, though they tried to make it into a veritable Chinese restaurant with all the side menu items and variations on the norm.  Frankly, those variations were all kind of weird. The standard one is the way to go!

For those keeping track, transfer in Tachikawa and take the Ome line for a ways.    The originality here comes from the three parts of the soup. First, a thick pork and chicken soup. Second, a tomato soup blend. Third, a healthy serving of pomodoro style tomato sauce.    The noodles, just thick enough to grab this sweet and spicy mix, are made on site.    Recommended if you happen to be out in this neck of the woods.    This shop is very near the Yokota military base, so maybe some servicemen can drag themselves away from the Taco Bell and give it a try!  You didn't know? There is a Taco Bell on the base!

Definitely not a spice level to be scared of, but up there none-the-less.    Is every good shop making random gentei these days?    Tasty, for sure, but make it a point to stick with the tsukemen if you haven't been to this, my #1 ramen shop in Japan.    Original review here.  ",

        "post": " gotsubo    The third shop from highly desirable Menya Shono is here, and I had an exclusive invite to the pre-open extravaganza! Well, me and every other ramen nerd in town.    Gotsubo can be read as 五坪, and translates to five tsubo. A tsubo is an old Japanese measurement of area; about three square meters. Yeah, the shop is a measly 15 square meters in size. More on this later.    The concept is vegetables. No, nothing vegetarian here, but the idea is that instead of noodles, you dip piles of colorful, fresh veggies into the soup. The menu is full of options.    It is artistic, colorful, and a lot of fun.    But . . .     . . . the line for this pre-open event was long, about 25 people. While this can be normal for popular ramen, the shop only seats six people, and the process of cooking vegetables and arranging the plate takes much, much longer than an average bowl of noodles. The normal noodle formula for a ramen line is (time to wait) = (# of people) x (4 minutes). So 25 means about an hour and a half. Try two and a half. In winter. The forecast called for snow in Tokyo.  I totally recommend this shop, but if there are more than five people waiting, you might want to question your devotion to noodles.

Congratulations on your Michelin star.    **This review is from 2013** Highly ranked shio and homemade noodles set Nakiryu apart from the countless chains that dominate the Otsuka area.  The shop's thick shio tare (the seasoning liquid that gives all the flavor) is made from extra high-grade kelp, dried scallops, and premium ago fish. And Mongolian salt.    This was the best egg I've had so far. That's number one out of approximately 2000 eggs I've had in bowls of ramen in Japan. And I can finally explain why. Ramen shops have pretty much perfected the ooey-gooey half cooked egg by now. It has always been that an egg is either bad, good, or great. How can you rank something with this three point scale? How is one great egg different from another great egg?  It comes down to the soup. More specifically, the impact / aftertaste level of the soup. A heavy soup, shoyu or tonkotsu, anything but shio to be honest, will overpower the light umami of the egg. This isn't a bad thing for the bowl overall, but it doesn't let the egg shine.  At Nakiryu, the egg can shine. I've never tasted such savory flavor.    Everyone in the shop (seven lunchtime slurpers) ordered the tantanmen, so I'll be back.    Official site here.

Please read my latest post if you are planning to check out this amazing ramen shop.  http://www.ramenadventures.com/2015/12/how-to-get-bowl-of-michelin-starred.html      Tsuta is the new king in town. Given the coveted #1 spot in the only ranking that really matters, Tokyo Ramen of the Year (TRY) magazine, for new shops.    This is shoyu perfection. Until now, shoyu at this level was only available at En and 69 n' Roll One; both shops about an hour from central Tokyo. Tsuta is only a minute walk from Sugamo Station on the Yamanote line. Super convenient.    It's all about the minor details. Tsuta's tare is made from a blend of three different soy sauces. The main is from Shodoshima (小豆島), a small island in the middle of Japan's Seto Inland Sea. The others are 生揚げ, raw unpasteurized soy sauces, from Ibaraki and Wakayama.  Sorry, no Kikkoman here.  The resulting taste is an intense, slightly sweet mix that suddenly puts Sugamo on the ramen map.    I work here in Sugamo once a week, so this is good news indeed.

I'm sure the kakuni topping was preserved in an airlock bag and shipped from some far off place, and I'm sure the soup was from a bottle of concentrated brown liquid. But it wasn't awful.

There are so few places trying to make a name with shio that you are pretty much guaranteed a spot on the annual lists.    A solid bowl, but nothing amazing. The shop occupies the old residence of Futaba, which I really loved. Armed with those memories of delicious ramen, Neiro had no chance with me.    But what's this? Today's special kakigori?    Yeeeeeeeesssssssssss! Kakigori, to branch as far away from ramen as possible for a minute, is Japanese shaved ice. But it is so much more. In the past (and present if you travel into the countryside), fresh river water was frozen in sheets and saved for the summer. The blocks are shaved with razor sharp blades to make this treat more of a cloud than a snowball.    And the toppings! Sugary syrup is strictly for the kids at the outdoor festivals. Real kakigori uses fresh everything. Expect juice squeezed at the shop, and honey infused with all kinds of flavors. On this day, the special was spicy ginger syrup topped with lime juice.  Fantastic.     View Larger Map   東京都杉並区天沼3-26-14 Tokyo, Suginami-ku, Amanuma 3-26-14 Closest station: Ogikubo  Open 11:30-20:00 Closed Tuesdays and some Wednesdays  ",

Back in 1960, the owner pulled a little yatai around the streets of Kabukicho, serving the late-night crowds. \"We want white soup! Cook it longer,\" they cried. Instead of going down the road of Hakata's well known yatais style, Hopuken made his own.  For 15 years he dragged that cart around. I can only imagine what Japan was like then.

Just take the big road by my house, and turn on another big road a few kilometers away. No need to write anything down! Simple!    But I turned one street too late, and though not lost, was unsure where this place was. The next 30 minutes were spent searching randomly. Finally I ran right into it! Lucky?    Nogata Hopu, though it looks intense, had almost no taste. I would have never thought such a heavy bowl could be flavorless.  This is abura style ramen. Pork stock, flavored with soy sauce, and topped with a lot of pork back fat. My all-time favorite in this genre is Sengoku Jiman.  But, yeah, this one had no taste.    Until I added a massive pile of the table-side kimchi and raw garlic. Then it just tasted like garlic and kimchi.    When I got home, shock! This Hopu was the wrong Hopu!

The location is prime for trade, historically at least, and the area developed with a huge Chinese and Dutch influence. During the sakoku period (鎖国) a small part of Nagasaki was open to foreign trade. Stepping foot on Japanese soil anywhere else meant a swift death.    What did this mean for food? Well, the area supposedly mixed Chinese, Japanese, and Dutch cuisine into one. Honestly, I found that the only real European thing was the castella cake, of which there is an abundance. The rest is an Asian fusion which, as expected, includes noodles.    This is champon, Nagasaki's gift to the ramen world.    Champon, unlike other noodle dishes, is a one pot dish. Soup is boiled, noodles are dumped in the soup, and toppings are added. The word champon can mean a mix of things. It is often referenced as a bad formula for drinking. Beer before liquor, never sicker. More like beer before shochu before sake before highballs in Japan. Don't champon!    But do eat the champon in Nagasaki.    Even Rilakuma is a fan. I was only able to eat at three of the dozens of shops, and would recommend Eiseiro as the top pick. It had a small-shop feel, while the others were massive Chinese restaurants that felt more like a banquet.  For an in-depth (and funny Engrish lesson) check out this link:  http://www.nagasaki.web-saito.net/changpong_en.html  By the way, of the dozen or so people I spoke with, most of them say Ringer Hut it their favorite. Go figure.    But what about ramen? Being Kyushu, you are sure to find a lot of good tonkotsu ramen shops. Most of the ramen is right around China Town. Not a lot, but enough for a tourist for sure.

Come with four or five people and you can have a Chinese feast. One can sample the champon, plus a few other things, by ordering the 4000 yen course. I went with just the champon. At 1500 yen, this is probably the most expensive one in Nagasaki. By comparison, the other two bowls I had were 1000 yen. Yeah, champon is on the spendy side.    But it lives up to the price when you see the toppings.    While the vegetables are strictly normal, the seafood it top notch. Yes, that is a shark fin on top. Also encountered were scallops, oysters, shrimp, squid, octopus, chicken meatballs, some kind of dumpling, a quail egg, and mysterious sea creature bits that might have been sea cucumber.  Mega-creamy soup. Too creamy to make this a regular dining spot.  If anything, this bowl was a lot of fun for a tourist like me.    I waited about an hour for a table, but that was during the annual lantern festival. Probably the busiest day of the year.

Actually, I wanted to go to highly-rated Kanro for lunch, but it turns out that the famous shop, located in the middle of Nagasaki's red light district, is only open at night.  Eiseiro was the next on the list. If you get lost (as I did), as any local shop owner. They all know where this one is. I asked someone who sells tortoise shell art.    Now this is what I am talking about! The soup: a simple clear broth. The noodles: hearty, but nothing too special. The toppings: crisp and colorful.  This bowl simply speaks for itself. If you need more convincing, I'll be glad to help. Somewhere in the mix of bright orange, pink, and green was a half cooked quail egg and a ginger-tinted chicken meatball. The octopus, squid, and fried pork were all lightly seasoned, a perfect match for those vegetables.    The saraudon was equally great. Saraudon is, 100% of the time, available at champon shops.Similar toppings over crispy fried noodles. While champon is kind of a ramen with Chinese flavors, saraudon is all Chinese.

Boat noodles are, by definition, rice noodles in a beefy broth that is flavor-enhanced with blood. All kinds of beef or pork parts can make their way in as toppings. This is an intense dish. From the amount of local press, some people are fanatical about this dish. Almost as fanatical as I am about ramen!    Here at Nara, the spicy version came recommended.  It was just so-so. The toppings, various cuts of beef and pork, were quite nice. But the soup was boring. And I'm never a huge fan of rice noodles that look like ramen noodles.

I chose the latter, and Ramen Bar Suzuki was the only place I ate at during my spring break holiday.    Around 150 ramen shops in Singapore alone. Other cities like Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur are also chock full of Japanese-style ramen. Most of these shops feel very artificial, though. All the big names like Ippudo, Chabuya, and Menya Musashi have food court ramen in department stores. It is weird, but that is how things work over here. Stand alone shops are very uncommon.    My good friend Take Suzuki actually helped produce quite a few of these shopping mall ramen shops. Finally, after a few years, he was able to branch off and open his own.    Great tonkotsu ramen in the heart of the city.    There is a big variety, with red, green, black, and white versions. I would recommend the white version, as good as you are used to back in Japan. Red is spicy, black garlicky, and green is a kind of Italian fusion thing.    The location is great. Almost on the banks of the Singapore River.    I'm not too knowledgeable about the geography of Singapore, but the riverside promenade that Suzuki is next to is three kilometers of bars. On both sides.  Like I said, great location. It is no wonder they are able to pack in around 300 bowls of ramen a day.    Great city for great food.

        "post": " 写楽    Onsen cities. These little resort towns cover the countryside extremities of Japan. If you have any interest in coming to Japan, you must spend a night or two soaking in the natural hot springs and eating local food.  Kusatsu is a very well known hot spring town  a few hours out of Tokyo in the mountains of Gunma. I've heard that former emperors were particularly fond of the healing waters, and had their staff (slaves?) haul water a few hundred  kilometers down from the mountains into Edo. It's good to be the king.    Choina Choina!  When it comes to onsen towns and food, kaiseki is the norm. The average tourist will stay at a ryokan, Japanese inn, and be provided with a fabulous spread, served in their room. We're talking about 15 course meals of local fish and game, freshly picked mountain vegetables, and seasonal bits of anything delicious.  Ramen in these towns is usually very sub-par.  I wandered into the almost empty Sharaku at about 10pm.    Unbelievable. This was some of the creamiest pork soup I've had. Perfection. Every aspect was great.    The owner and his wife, both 26 years old, haven't just created a great ramen shop, they've made a cool spot to hang out and drink. Gang Starr on the stereo provided the ice breaker I needed, and I ended up drinking with them and some regulars until late.    Solid shoyu as well, though go with the tonkotsu.    This is a sort of minor trend I have noticed lately. Move to the big city, learn ramen, get married, then move back to your sleepy countryside hometown and open your own shop.  Rent is cheap, customers are laid back, and you can soak in the hot springs daily. Not a bad life!

        "post": " つけめん＆らーめん 東京Mods    If you ever take one of Japan's cross-country buses from Shinjuku station to wherever, you'll probably pass by this shop. On my last trip out of town I just happened to be staring out the window and just happened to see ramen. Tokyo Mods immediately went on my ramen to-do list.    A funky spot for sure. The counter is practically on the street. A street you would expect to be filled with modified 1960s scooters. The more headlights, the better! Alas, the mod style of the Quadrophenia age is non-existent in Tokyo. You'll have to settle for a couple British flags as decoration.    And quirky warnings. No fencing!    But, thankfully, filming for TV was ok. This was the second shop of the day, after being rejected by the owner of a nearby tonkotsu shop. Who wouldn't want the free press?    Tokyo Mods is excellent. The soup is as thick as most tsukemen shops out there (tukemen is written on their awning, but we'll forgive the inconsistency). Mods uses an uncommon chicken-heavy soup. It immediately sets it apart from the norm.    Standard practice with tsukemen is for a ladle of soup owari to be added at the end. Often a simple dashi broth, this thins the sauce-like soup into something you can drink down. Trust me, you're going to want to savor every drop at some of these places.  Tokyo Mods, keeping with originality, provides a thick vegetable instead. Suddenly, you've got something like minestrone in front of you. The veggies change daily, by the way.    A great concept, it totally works.     View Larger Map   東京都豊島区高田3-22-12 Tokyo, Toshima-ku, Takada 3-22-12 Closest station: Takadanobaba  Open 11:30-16:00 Closed Sundays  ",

Technically, it is the closest residential hood to the famous skyscraper district (unless you count the massive homeless population in nearby Chuo Park).

        "post": " 豚のさんぽ    Talk about an adventure! I didn't even plan on eating ramen this day.    Even though Niigata has at least three magazines dedicated to local ramen, I was more interested in the seafood. Cruising along the coast, there are a handful of markets where the older moms and wives of the fishermen sell the daily catch.    Breakfast on the coast did not disappoint. An entire crab for less than 1000 yen. I guess she liked my enthusiasm, and the extra half was thrown in for free.  This is local food in Japan. Anyone who has toured by car, bike, or bicycle knows what I am talking about. Please try get off the beaten path.    So I was just riding the bike into the mountains, in search of some remote hot springs. Then . . . this!    End of the road. It was still about five kilometers to the destination, which obviously was not going to be the destination anymore. Then, a minute later, a group of skiers appear. How cool is that! Skiing down a snowed-in road!    Oh, this guy? He rounds the corner and says, in Japanese, \"Are you that ramen guy?\"  It was then and there I knew that I needed to go eat ramen.    Stopping for some free wi-fi and coffee in Hakuba.    I found the nearest acceptable spot.    Into the GPS it goes.    Done!  I had a veritable hero's welcome when I rolled the bike up in front of Butanosanpo. Yes, countryside Japan is still fascinated with us foreigners. The bike, a bright orange KTM, makes a bit of a statement, too.    This shop isn't just a ramen shop. The menu is full of pork options. The name of the shop is, anyways, buta no sanpo, meaning a pig's casual stroll. And though this spot is far enough in the countryside to mean that almost no one will take a casual stroll here, the point is taken.    Plates of pork curry, thick kakuni over rice, and all kinds of sides.    Two styles of ramen. The light gaku ramen, and the heavy jiro inspired style.  Eating jiro and riding the bike isn't an option, so the light one it had to be. Get the extra chashu. Thin and melts in your mouth. As expected from a place with buta, pork, in the name.    If you can eat a quadruple-sized serving in less than 20 minutes, you eat for free.    Next time!

Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan without touching an expressway. Twenty four mountain passes was the goal. It was epic.    This annual ride always ends at the Monzen Hotel in Niigata. Less than 5000 yen for a night, plus a hot spring and restaurant. These kinds of places are commonplace in Japan, and simply searching for \"Business Hotel\" instead of your standard Hiltons and Hyatts can save you a fortune on your travels.    What's this? Homemade shoyu ramen? While I was content on fried octopus and beer, I couldn't pass this one up. An inquiry revealed that the soup is made in house.    What followed was shocking. The soup? Perhaps homemade, but it tasted like something out of a can of concentrate that had been diluted too much. And that wasn't even the worst part!    Noodles shouldn't do this. A massive brick of noodles, some mushy, some barely cooked.  The Ride  The ride? I just joined the Day 1, while my friends went off to see other parts of Japan. Looks fun, sorry I couldn't go.    Twistybutt is named after the Iron Butt, an internationally recognized ride of 1000 miles in one day.    That's 1600km for you people on the other system of measurement.  I did an Iron Butt ride once. Never again.    Very few photos from this day of riding. The coast to coast ride goes from 4am until about 9pm, with very few chances to stop and take photos.

        "post": " IKEMEN    Straight from Japan to America, and back to Japan. IKEMEN Hollywood is the most buzz-worthy thing in ramen in Japan at the moment.    The story started with Nakamuraya being recognized as one of the stellar bowls in Japan. Years later, and Nakamura-san himself made the move to America. Southern California.    What followed is a confusing account of failed ventures ranging from a ramen food truck to a molecular gastronomy ramen shop to who knows what else.  I've heard that Nakamura-san is out in New York now, running some sort of noodle factory. He left in his LA-wake IKEMEN, a shop that I visited sometime last year. I wasn't impressed.  But, to my surprise, Japan wanted to see what was up with this spot, minus the 11 hour flight. There is now a temporary IKEMEN at the Shin-Yokohama Raumen Museum.    Let's get right to the weird menu item. The Ghost Buster Dip has a roasted marshmallow thrown into the soup. The entire shop smells faintly of burnt s'mores. The taste is what you would expect from melting marshmallows into your soup. Whether that is good or bad is up to you.    I will just leave it at that.    The fiery Backdraft Dip is topped with an entire dried chile! Kind of waste of a chile, but it looks good in photos.  Anyways, about these bowls, they are much better than the Hollywood versions. The reason? It is the noodles. These are sourced from Mikawaya Seimen, the local king of locally produced noodles. A big improvement.    The winner here was the ramen. The mushroom ramen uses a ton of quality bonito for a rich, smoky taste. You can even order an extra serving of the flakes, freshly shaved. Combined with the mushrooms, it is an umami explosion.    I don't think many people will go for the ramen, though, when the tsukemen has names like Johnny Dip, Ghostbuster Dip, and Backdraft Dip!    Official Site Here  ",

The soup is less fishy than other Takayama shops, though just by a little.    Apologies for the weak photos from the Takayama set. The DSLR was out of batteries and I was forced to use my iPad. Yes, I was one of those guys taking photos with an iPad. I won't make that mistake again.

So of course the ramen shop that had been recommended was closed. The next option was the only option. Nanairo is open late. Well . . . later.    My first foray into Takaya Ramen was a miss. Noodles tasted like instant, the soup was forgettable, and the menma was dry.    But the 1000 yen plate of fried rice topped with local Hida-beef was fantastic. My coworkers scoffed at my suggestion of a proper Hida-gyu dinner, which usually runs about $50-$100 a person for a decent steak, so this would have to do. And it did.    I quickly changed my train ticket home to give me enough time to eat some proper ramen the next day.      岐阜県高山市天満町6丁目9 Gifu-ken, Takayama-shi, Tenmanmachi 6-9 Closest station: Takayama  Maybe open until midnight  ",

        "post": "  高山市    Up in the far reaches of Gifu prefecture, nestled in the Northern Alps, is Hida-Takayama, more commonly just called Takayama. It means tall mountain (高山), which applies to a few places here and there in Japan. Luckily, this Takayama is #1 in terms of tourism, and it is a must-hit for people with a train pass and more than a few weeks in Japan.  Takayama city boasts history, culture, and food. They even have their own style of ramen.        The ramen here is a simple shoyu, and the soup is heavy on the katsu. Despite the very dark color, it is one of the most refreshing local bowls out there. The quality of water really shines!        Noodles are thin and springy, reminiscent of the instant ones you can buy in bulk at the supermarket. In a good way.        The city seemed to have about a dozen ramen shops within walking distance of the station. Outside of that radius . . . this is countryside Japan. I stayed at a hotel that was a 10 minute drive, and we couldn't even find a convenience store near us.        Takayama's other big food attraction is the beef. 飛騨牛. Hida-gyu is locally raised wagyu, some of the best in Japan. No trip is complete without some of the stuff served raw on rice, sushi style. Very delicious. I could eat a couple of these everyday if it wasn't 500 yen for one serving.        The mountain springs mean good water and good rice. That means nihonshu.         Plenty of free samples to try, plenty of things to buy, all in the old town area.        If you are planning a trip up here, you don't need to give yourself much time. After walking around for a couple hours, I had seen it all.        I even had time to soak my feet in a foot onsen near the station.        Go for the ramen, or a nice steak, then stick around for some of what countryside Japan is famous for. If you have transportation, there are a plethora of spots within driving distance.      By train, you can take the Bullet Train to Nagoya and transfer to an express train. There are buses from Shinjuku as well that take about 6 hours, and are a lot cheaper.

Enter Marucho. An instant top 5.    The soup, though thinner than the other styles, is full of meat and onion bits. So much so that every bit of noodles includes a fair share of umami chunks.    And the soup-owari. Refreshing, with a kick of spicy and vinegary.    As expected, a lunch only spot.

I actually recommend Toyoko Inn. There are branches all over the country, usually next to the station, and you always know what you are going to get. I've stayed at some off-brand business hotels that were less than ideal.    So when a friend recommended a ramen shop by the same name as my hotel, a few minutes walk from my hotel, I had to go.    Toyoko is super old school.    Greasy, worn out menus were unnecessary, as the standard miso with extra vegetables is the way to go.    Known for overly salty broth, Toyoko serves their noodles with a side of clear, hot broth. Dilute it as much as you want, but I recommend slurping those noodles as is.    The super strong taste is popular with, for some reason, a bunch of older Japanese rock bands. Sorry, I'm no expert on the sounds of Akanofuru and Heroine, Champagne, or Big Mama.    Sorry about that.      新潟県新潟市中央区南笹口1-1-38 コープオリンピア笹口1F Niigata-ken, Niigata-shi, Chou-ku, Minamisasaguchi 1-1-38 Closest station: Niigata  Open 11:00-22:00 Tuesdays 11:00-14:00  ",

Very far from the bullet trains that connect Tokyo with the rest of the prefecture. Not a place you would expect a line.    But the line was massive. At least 50 people. A testament that ramen isn't just a big-city-Tokyo thing in Japan.    The menu at Agosuke is deep. Shoyu, shio, with corresponding kotteri (thick) versions. There are also limited gentei bowls, and certain bowls that are only available for lunch or dinner. Add to that side dishes, and this place is meant to pleas everyone.    I'm a big fan of limited bowls, but wanted to take this rare opportunity to try the original. So I compromised with an order of limited gyoza. Packed with fresh vegetables and some spice, these were a good choice.    And the original bowl of shoyu. Another good choice. The shop, true to their moniker, uses an ago soup. That's fried flying fish. It is much lighter than, say, a niboshi (sardine) or katsuo (skipjack tuna) based broth.    If you have the appetite, go for extra chashu. Only 300 km from Tokyo!

The above photo was taken at the Ebisu Circuit up in the Bandai area. World famous as a premier drift racing track, it also caters to motorcycle racers.    And there is a zoo on site. Yeah, cost of admission to ride the track includes a fun day at the zoo.    Completely random, completely awesome. Only in Japan.  When we woke up at the campsite on Sunday morning, rain. Not super heavy, but enough to curtail a day of touring in the mountains that we had planned. I had managed to even sway the other riders to hit the mountain roads until 11am, then head down to Shirakawa, a town on the border of Fukushima and Ibaraki for a lunchtime bowl.  The rain had everyone jumping onto the expressway for an early ride home. Only two of us remained. Two die-hard ramen fans. But it was only 6am. What ramen shops are open at 6am?    Bannai, Makoto Shokudo, Ippei, Abe Shokudo, Kiichi, and Asian Shokudo. That's where!  Even though it was about 30 minutes out of our way, Kitakata is one of the only places in Japan with an asa-ra culture. Breakfast ramen. Legit.    This is Makoto Shokudo. With a 60 year history spanning four generations, you know you're going to get a hearty bowl.    Standard Kitakata style. Wavy noodles in that simple shoyu soup, heavy on the niboshi. Tender chashu.    The shop is huge, with individual Japanese-style rooms available for families, as well as a counter and tables next to the kitchen.    Did I mention this is the owner's house? Don't go upstairs!  This spot was packed at 7:30am.

Akasaka is home to IT firms, TV production headquarters, hotels, and money. There aren't many ramen shops, but you can easily find expensive Belgium beer, tapas, and some Michelin-starred kaiseki cuisine. And now 69'n'Roll One.    Let me say that the original shop in Machida was a total dualistic nightmare. On one hand, the ramen was amazing. Often given the number one award for whatever magazine or association was giving out awards at the time, this was a must-eat for any true ramen fan. On the other hand, the shop was randomly closed most times I went. When I did make it, they enforced that crazy no sound rule. No sound but the slurping of your ramen. Some people respected that about it. I didn't. To put it frankly, it is a dumb idea.    Now the new shop in Akasaka. They completely flipped everything! The shop is big. You probably won't have to wait long, and using your phone to text while you sit, chatting with friends, it is all good. There is a big American diner feel going on here.  But then there is the ramen.  While the original shop was lovingly made day in and day out by the master, or by his meticulously trained disciples, this new shop feels amateur. The kitchen is hidden away in the back, so your guess is as good as mine.  Skip this one, and head to Tsuta instead.

Why even bother with a third, you've got the town covered!    But it is all about style with Mutahiro. Different shops for different styles. While the other two do a niboshi and chicken ramen, respectively, this new one is mazesoba.    I've got my VIP sticker on my phone, and this is opening day.    I should mention why I think this is strange, opening a third shop here. Kokubunji isn't such a massive station. Less than 20 minutes from Shinjuku, there are at least five other stations in the vicinity that would get more business. But maybe it isn't about business. Maybe it is just all about love for Kokubunji.    And this dude has it!    The mazesoba definitely falls below the other two on my list, with the mound of moyashi bean sprouts being a massive negative point for me. I just can't get into them, and the fact that they are classified as a vegetable is kind of a joke.    But with the heavy tare and plenty of stir-fried pork, the bowl comes together in the end. Check this one out after the others. Who knows, maybe you live in Kokubunji!  What will shop number four be? Jiro-kei? Tantanmen? Give it an about a year, at this rate.

Otherwise, Tsukada Nojo is just a tasty place specializing in chicken from Miyazaki prefecture.    Tsukada Nojo highlights local cuisine from the south of Japan. Definitely not a famous area for ramen.  That is a nice way of saying that the toridashi tsukemen wasn't that hot. And that was after drinking a whole bottle of Miyazaki shochu, a Japanese liquor made from sweet potatoes.    But the rest of the menu was fantastic.    にら釜玉 - Garlic chive topped with an egg yolk. That radioactive-orange yolk, mixing with the sharp ponzu and slightly bitter veggies was a standout dish.    地鶏炭火焼 - Local chicken fried with charcoal. This is the shop's most famous order. The charcoal is supposed to not only add flavor, but health benefits as well.    地頭鶏たたき - Local chicken sashimi. This might be off the menu during the hotter months, but the rest of the year, raw chicken is on the menu in Japan. A wonderful texture that might remind you of fish, if you didn't know.

Warning, this page will make you hungry!    Will Tomita, Japan's #1 ranked tsukemen shop and winner of last year's Grand Tsukemen Fest, defend their belt? Or will another solid shop, like Ganja or Rokurinsha, take home the win. Or maybe one of the less traditional bowls; miso tsukemen from Men Furaido in Hokkaido or chicken paitan tsukemen from Kimuzukashiya.  From October 10th, this event is going to take Shinjuku by storm. 11am until 9pm everyday, you can join the fun. I'm looking forward to seeing some of you there.

        "post": " ローリング蕎麦ット    Who put soba in my tsukemen? Who put tsukemen in my soba?    Rolling Sobat makes very little sense, both culinary and visually, but we like that. The atmosphere is inspired by the long history of pro wrestling in Japan. Masked fighters battling in their own signature style. The Rolling Sobat is an actual move; a jumping, spinning back kick meant to send an opponent to the floor.    You see what they did? The move is written as ローリングソバット (roringu sobatto). Substitute 蕎麦, the kanji for the noodles, and you have a fun little play on words.    Anyways, they serve soba. Traditional buckwheat soba.    Soba has a long history in Japan, predating ramen by centuries. The buckwheat noodles are served almost exclusively with a simple dashi; a broth made from konbu kelp and dried bonito fish flakes. Topping are minimal, though mountain vegetables or maybe some tempura are commonly seen as additions.    Rolling Sobat, on the other hand, makes a meaty pork broth. Everything about this bowl screams Tokyo tsukemen; everything but the noodles. And it works. You miss out on the bite, that chewy texture that you can only get from wheat noodles made with kansui alkaline water.    Conveniently located in Shibuya (across from one of the best Japanese micro-brew bars Goodbeer Faucets). Definitely check this one out when you are in the mood for something a little different.

        "post": " So, this happened.    The ramen adventure here is overshadowed, eclipsed more like it, by the reason for my hospitalization.  Driving home by motorcycle on Honandori, just past famous the famous ramen shop Eifukucho Taishoken, I was cut off and hit by a black car. Hit and run. It was a low speed crash, but the bike fell on me just right. Just enough to transfer all the energy of the impact into the fibula and tibia bones of my leg.  The above CT scan illustrates my point.    The first couple of days after the accident were spent in traction. Immobile, except for my right arm. Luckily, all I need to eat ramen is my right arm!    Tomita is one of the highest ranked tsukemen shops in Japan. The shop has a perpetual line; often over an hour. Well, if you don't want to wait, or make the trek out to Chiba, you can pick up a limited edition, ready-to-eat bowl at your local 7-11.    This isn't instant by any means. The noodles are cooked, and the toppings are real. Even the tiny slivers of yuzu peel are fresh.  Yes, the whole deal has a bit of a factory-made feel to it, and this pales in comparison to the original. But the fact that someone, pent up in a hospital, can enjoy a real bowl of tsukemen with ease is a testament to ramen culture in Japan.  By the way, Tomita will once again be at this year's Grand Tsukemen Fest from October 17th. They are the defending champ of the all-tsukemen festival, so expect a line.    Abram, Hiroshi, and Kei delivered this tasty treat. Big thanks to all my ramen fans who came through during visiting hours. You guys don't know how monotonous the hospital stay was, and I am grateful for your visits.    I'm now at my apartment recovering. The surgery went very well, and there was almost no pain about 12 hours after. Modern science is amazing. I can't put weight on it for about another month, but this is just how it goes. Wheelchairs and leg braces are my reality for a while.  That's another way of saying that Ramen Adventures will be taking a bit of a break (pun totally intended!) for a bit. I have a couple reviews queued up, but my streak of a new review every two days has officially ended.  Thank you for understanding.  ",

Tuesday to Friday the shops is called Gamushara, serving a ginger heavy shoyu ramen. On the weekends, Yahiko serves miso tsukemen and ramen.  I as ecstatic when Dokkan, my favorite of the three, would open as a second shop just down the road.    The menu looks to be exactly the same.    How much seabura do you want? Yes, this is pork back fat, which sounds better if you just keep to the Japanese word. Seabura is silky and rich. Go for the 鬼あぶ - devil's size -  if you are in the mood.    They've only been open for a week, which is why I'll forgive them for something being off. It was still good, and I will probably go here anytime I am drinking in the neighborhood, but the impact of the original just wasn't there.

Fitting that a good friend would show up at my apartment with one of their famous gift packs.  These gift packs are unique. Instead of a manufactured soup, something made to resemble the original, Taishoken fills a big jar straight from the same pot the in-store customers dine from. Along with fresh noodles and a pack of their special menma, this is about as close to the real thing as you can get.    The soup, even when frozen, smelled fantastic. All that niboshi fishiness, with a hint of yuzu citrus. Fantastic.  And for someone stuck in a wheelchair on a 4th floor walk-up apartment, this was definitely something I needed.    To be honest, the noodles didn't come out so great. This is most likely due to human error. The Ramen Adventure's kitchen isn't a place for cooking ramen. The timing, as well as the amount of time it takes me to get from the kitchen to the table, wasn't ideal. So I dumped some white rice in left over soup. Good stuff!  Kiss me once, kiss me twice, give me niboshi-pork-chicken soup with rice!  If you live in Japan, you can order online here, and have a bowl in the next couple of days. How cool is that!  ",

We did a whole bit where I got behind the counter and made a bowl at Gamushara. It didn't make it in to the final cut. Too bad! We also filmed Shimoyama-san getting wrapped up by my pet snake, but that didn't make it in either. Too bad!    ",

And with Singapore's reputation for true fusion cuisine, an eight-colored serving of Xiao Long Bao is no surprise.    Original, ginseng, foei gras, black truffle, cheese, crab roe, garlic, and Sichuan pepper. It looks gimmicky. It looks delicious. The atmosphere of the shop, located in upscale Ginza, looks expensive.    Luckily, Paradise Dynasty's dumplings are affordable and tasty. The lunch set is just about 1500 yen for the dumplings and some sides.    Each one quite different from the last. A fun little culinary journey.    Saved the best for last. Sichuan numbing pepper.    How about the ramen? At lunch they offer, in typical Chinese restaurant style, half a dozen noodle sets. Creamy paitan ramen, a few kinds of hot and cold tantanmen, and a smattering of seasonal offerings.    The noodles are pretty poor. I have to say, the dumpling-only set, with all eight flavors and a side of soup and rice, is the way to go.

        "post": " Week 3    気むずかし家 - Kimuzukashiya really brought it with this surprise winner. Beautiful fried chicken, made from local birds from the Shinshu region of Japan, were standard. They could easily have charged 300 yen for this exquisite topping. The soup was just light enough to balance with the tartar sauce and homemade pickles. And the noodles? Premium.    無心 - Muttepo was great as expected. The head shop is famous for the lack of smell, a common problem with straight tonkotsu soups. At the show, though, this bowl was stinky! Given the outdoor nature of the event, we can let this one slide. Hints of yuzu citrus were a bonus.    肉玉そばおとど - Otodo was the most normal of the bunch. A bit garlicky, this one left me smelling of the stinking rose for the next few hours.    IKEMEN HOLLYWOOD was actually kind of tasty. I would recommend it as a good option for a 2nd bowl. The deluxe topping set came with an onsen egg, extra pork, and a massive pile of freshly shaved bonito flakes. Not a bowl I'd eat often, but a perfect palate cleanser for a multi-bowl day.    頑者 - The biggest disappointment of the show so far was Ganja. They are known for really bringing it at these tsukemen events. Every year their bowl seemed to have a bigger impact, a bigger hit of gyokai flavors. This year, though, it was bland and boring. The spicy sauce was their draw, but it wasn't enough to bring this one up from the forgettable shops of the year.    五福星. And the worst was by far Ufushin. What the hell is going on here? The above is the regular tsukemen, a sakura shrimp infused, slightly spicy, utterly forgettable mess. The mega-topping set, for an extra 1000 yen included:   a massive peice of chashu bacon an entire tonteki pork loin steak, fried in garlic and ginger sauce garlic chips garlic toast soy-soaked eggs   This was simply grotesque. I felt sick after. And I only ate about a third of it. What were they thinking!  ",

        "post": " 大つけ麺博  Here is the order I would rank the 2nd week's entries. I have to preface it, though, with the weather. The weather has been either frigid and rainy, or humid and warm these days. This plays a huge roll with the Grand Tsukemen Fest. The bowls are plastic, and you are sitting outdoors. Thus, on colder day, the soup is quick to mellow.    中華蕎麦 とみ田- Tomita, as expected, was the clear winner. Amazing noodles and a soup that is outstanding. This is the gold standard of tsukemen in Japan, and I won't be surprised if the 2012 champion is also the 2013 champion. On the rainy days, they were the only shop with a line.    麺屋 白神 - Hakushin was an unexpected surprise. The soup, a ginger and miso blend, when mixed with the fried ginger pork topping was a meal on its own.    竹本商店☆つけ麺開拓舎 - Takemoto Shoten decided to take the best of the north and make a bowl of it. Hinai chicken is considered one of the top three chickens in Japan, and this soup is full of it. Add in Akita pork, and plenty of dried sardines and roasted shrimp heads. Intense, warming, and not too thick.    博多一幸舎 - Ikosha, hailing from Hakata in the southern island of Kyushu, decided not to go with the standard Kyushu tonkotsu. Instead, they made more of a Tokyo-style tsukemen. It was ok, but I forgot the taste after an hour.    ラーメンJACKSON'S - I really wanted to love this one. Osaka is known for bucking the rules and making crazy decisions when it comes to food. This bowl was chock-full of blue crab and pork bones. But . . . in the middle of a cold autumn typhoon, the soup got cold too quickly and the taste plummeted. Good when piping hot, inedible when cold.    麺処蒼生 - If toppings were the only factor, Aoi would have been at the top! The slow business day meant that they were unloading extra free toppings on customers. Hence the six slices of slow cooked chicken, the two chicken meatballs, the two pork meatballs, and the egg hidden in the soup. Aoi is officially certified as a promoter of local Gunma products, so I feel a little bad putting them at the bottom of the list. Again, I had this on a cold, rainy day, and the taste reflected this. I'll make it to the original shop someday soon and give a proper review!  Like Milli Vanilli said, \"Blame it on the rain!\"  ",

They sit around a digital koi pond and the fish swim to the people who are meant to comment. There is also a CG robot announcer with an annoying high pitch voice. Welcome to Japan.    This time, they just filmed me sitting at my desk blogging and talking.  Actually, with NHK, they aren't allowed to promote any business, since it is a government sponsored channel. So the quotes about specific shops are a bit on the mysterious side. For the record, I spoke about:  King Kong Sabu-chan Hayashi   Also, they didn't mention the actual name of my blog, which meant that very few people learned anything about finding great ramen from this show. Weak! I think the site stats showed about 1000 people hitting Ramen Adventures. In contrast, a prime-time show on another channel might give me 100,000 page views.  ",

The quail eggs are a nice touch. This bowl was worthy of the long line. Over an hour at times.    稲葉 (Inaba) is some of the thickest tori paitan I've had. It is almost like chicken gravy. The perfect bowl to balance out the rest of the menu at the Grand Tsukemen Fest.    吉田商店 (Yoshida Shoten) is a thinner tori paitan than Inaba. The extra-option-topping, duck chashu, should be ordered. I like all the extras going on here. Chicken meatballs, yuzu peel, and some spinach. Solid!    麺や而今 (Jikon) throws as much in the soup as they can; chicken, pork, beef, and seafood. The noodles, made with roasted wheat germ, were my favorite this week.    毘侍家 (Bija) from Kyushu stays as true to bowl from Kurume, in the southern island of Japan, can be if it had to be a bowl of tsukemen. You won't find much tsukemen culture in Kyushu. I longed for a kaedama of nice firm, thin noodles to dump in this soup.    風來堂 (Furaido) brings Sapporo miso to town. The chashu is fantastic, made by simmering pork cheek in only high quality soy sauce not once, but twice. The rest of the bowl, though, was kind of weak.  Lines can get long for the top shops, best to get here with time to spare!  http://dai-tsukemen-haku.com/en  ",

The pink is ladies size (smaller and ladies only), and the yellow one is for a 0% alcohol beer. There are plenty of nearby convenience stores if you want to bring in your own real beer.    If you love using your smartphone for everything, you can handle your tickets with the tixee app. It's in Japanese though. Acts like a fastpass for the long lines!    Then get in line! On the opening day, a Thursday afternoon, the lines weren't bad at all. The weekends should be a bit more. I can't make any predictions; maybe 30-40 minutes for a popular shop.    If you can read the Kanji characters, there are plenty of shop banners to lead you.    Or just go with the photo. Couldn't be easier!    When you get to the front of the line, you can order extra toppings for some extra yen. Most shops do something like this one; an egg for 100 yen and extra chashu pork for 200 yen. Some shops will have crazy topping choices, so save those coins.    The next step . . . eat! You can sit anywhere you want. Because tsukemen noodles are served cold, you don't need to rush this one like you would with a bowl of ramen.    When you are ready to leave, take your tokens (you get one with each bowl) to the voting boxes.    And give the best bowl your votes. Who will win the 2013 Grand Tsukemen Fest?  Join me and find out? I'll be coming to the event off and on throughout the next month, but for sure I will be there every Sunday evening at 7pm. It is the official \"Ramen Adventures オフ会 Offline Meeting!\"  Nothing major, just a good time for English speakers, expats, locals, and travelers alike, to meet up and have a few bowls together. Feel free to join the Facebook events page and invite anyone you want.  https://www.facebook.com/events/167454580121963  7pm at the ticket machines. Hope to see you there!  ",

No one else has succeeded so much with only beef bones. While other shops have tried, their soup ends up being too sweet, or too funky, or just plain bad.          So when the master decided to expand to a second shop, we were all a bit surprised at the choice. Instead of another beef-centric style, maybe a tsukemen or a mazesoba, he went with miso.    Miso! Miso is the one type that has more utter disappointments than successes in Japan. It is also the type that I hate reviewing the most. Why? Because most people love the average bowl. And when you criticize something people love, people stop inviting you out.          Obviously there were high expectations here.       And Matador's miso delivered. The secret blend of misos (shhhh, it is white miso from Kyoto and red miso from Nagano) are just the beginning. Of course, the eye immediately sees that meat; a massive piece of roasted beef rib chashu (aha! they did put some beef in this one). Underneath the beef is a silky chunk of prime fat. The master, Iwata-san, explained that you should immediately exhale after eating this piece. The creamy, fatty フーーーー of you breath is more sensation than taste.     But wait, there's more. Also on the menu is a shoyu-koji ramen. Koji had a bit of a boom last year, and was gone before you could wikipedia what it was. A fermented blend of rice and shoyu, it fits with the miso theme. The taste is almost miso-light.      Nice shop, too. A basement floor has enough seating to keep the lines shorter than they could be.

Shono, an awesome tonkotsu place just east of Shinjuku, gave way to Gachi, a fried-chicken-tsukemen spot in the middle of Shinjuku's gay-bar neighborhood. Next came Gotsubo, a tiny shop serving vege-centric noodles, next to Shinjuku's famous park. The latest, Gachi Aburasoba, goes with nothing but soupless noodles. Yes, in Shinjuku.    I live in Shinjuku, which made the wheelchair commute less painful than it could have been.    The concept of aburasoba is simple. Just leave out the soup, add a little extra tare seasoning sauce, and make sure there is plenty of high quality abura, fat, to bring the dish together.    Aburasoba can be hit or miss. Without the soup, the noodles need to be extra special. The larger aburasoba chain shops in Tokyo source their noodles from a factory. Not good.  Gachi makes theirs in the back. The thick ones, futomen, are outstanding. The noodle chef bills them as nama-pasta-chuka; fresh pasta Chinese style. Some of the best I've had.    And the oils. 太白胡麻油, sesame oil, and 亜麻仁油, flax seed oil, are both healthy and delicate. Not something you see much at ramen shops.    Add on a dollop of homemade seabura, pork back fat, and mix away.    Also on hand was a thin noodle version. Not bad, but it paled in comparison with those thick ones. Some of the best in town.    They opened on October 1st, so check it out if you have time for lunch in Shinjuku.

Historically an important route, it is now a traffic-packed 8-lane road that lets you know loud and clear that you probably should have spent the extra yen for the expressway.    But the slew of 2-ton trucks need places to stop, and hearty ramen is a popular option. The crowds here aren't drawn bu subtle kodawari taste, but by variety and calories.    Ryumeikan serves a dozen or so different bowls. The most popular?    Stamina ramen. I prefer the Ibaraki-style of stamina ramen, with liver and pumpkin being the stamina ingredients of choice. Here, in more of a Saitama-fashion, that extra boost of energy is coming from garlic, nira (garlic chives), more garlic, and some sliced chicken.  A piping hot bowl that will leave you reeking afterwords.    The miso ramen topped with spicy onion is another popular menu item.

        "post": " 肉玉そば おとど    For a recent TV shoot, we were asked to go to Otodo in Koenji. I'd never been there. While the original shop in Chiba commands long lines and respectable rankings, this one down the PAL arcade street in Koenji always looked rather chain-ish to me.    We were asked to actually recommend this one as our top pick for shops that were participating in the 2013 Grand Tsukemen Fest. I'm not a \"TV talent\", and I refuse to recommend bad ramen; both on this site and in the media. Luckily (for the crew of six) Otodo is decent enough to get a nod.    The concept is a little strange; tsukemen that matches with rice. Often, some white rice is dumped into a bowl after the noodles are done. At Otodo, though, you are meant to eat the rice and noodles together. Yeah, they suggest that you put noodles on the rice as a topping.  I have to say, this was dumb. The noodles are cooked softer than average to accommodate this . . . technique.  Look, the rice is free here, so give it a try if you want. Then get back to eating your tsukemen like a normal person.    The way that I do it is to dump that raw egg on the rice, top it with some of the fried pork, and go from there. Donburi-style, the garlic-heavy pork stir-fry is excellent. A word of warning, you will stink after this one.  Even though there is no connection to Tokushima-style ramen, this bowl is like a cross between that and some Chiba gatsuri. Heavy stuff for workin' dudes.    Did our TV recommendation drive any sales to Otodo?    3rd place at the festival! Way to go guys!

I said I wouldn't go this year, but the nice weather meant that I should probably leave the house. 10am is a good time to show up, as the lines weren't too bad.    You can safely jump in the longest one at this time, and only have to endure about 30 minutes. Later in the day and you can expect hours.    This was a collaboration bowl from a top shop in Akita and a top shop in Miyagi. The Tokyo Ramen Show is all about collaborations. Once in a lifetime chances to try something unique. Famous shops teaming up, local cities putting their best bowl forward, and a lot of one-off experiments.    Last year, this ebisoba bowl was just awful.    The Nagoya crew's line was short, but their spirits were in full force.    The dude with the mohawk? He is the owner of Mohican Ramen in Kyushu.    Nakamoto, the mega-famous red-hot ramen shop, always teams up with someone for this event. Last year was with Ippudo, and this year was with Shinpu, another Kyushu tonkotsu joint.    90% Shinpu, 10% Nakamoto. I prefer that ratio, as Nakamoto's spice tends to be a bit much. Just a little kick for good measure here.    Mr. Ikuta, aka Mr. Nagi, helped with a group collaboration that did a different style every couple of days. How was their Onomichi style ramen?    Very nice!    Gari Gari Kun!    Free stickers.    The event has a whole row of extra stuff. Like this ramen quiz booth, set up by the Japan Ramen Association. Featuring Renge-chan (spoon girl).    I almost answered everything without having to look at the answers. The four questions on the questionnaire (win a button!) were:  Who was the first Japanese person to eat ramen? When did Ogikubo's Harukiya first open? Was is the full name of the Nisshin Corporation? When did the Tokyo Ramen Show first start?    Thank you Osaki-san for being the man behind this event. Please put more chairs out next time! When the boss has to sit on a flower planter, you know the place is packed.    The event will go until November 24th. Check it out if you have the time. As always, nothing was stellar (eating out of plastic bowls outside isn't ideal ramen conditions), but the event is a fun, random food experience. If you want my ranking of the bowls I tried, here you go:   The Akita x Miyagi collab. Great chicken flavor with a kick of seafood. Tomita x Daruma. Creamy Hakata tonkotsu with the roughness of Tomita's signature soup. Nakamoto x Shinpu. My favorite Hakata spot with a spicy kick. Onomichi-style. A bunch of Ramen Association dudes mucking around making good ramen. Hakodate \"ocean\" ramen. Shio ramen with tons of seafood flavors.   I'd suggest getting a bowl at a spot with a short line, then eating that bowl while you wait in a longer line. Hours waiting on an empty stomach is bad for your health!

To quote my 7th grade French teacher, who also taught us international manners, \"If you don't have anything good to say about something, say it is interesting.\"    Food-wise, ramen is at the bottom of the list of Hamamatsu food. Number one is surely unagi, eel from nearby Lake Hamaman. There are quality shops on every block, as long as you have the money to spend. Number two is gyoza. For some reason the per-capita of pot sticker shops is one of the highest in the nation. From just walking around a bit, I'd say that trendy trattorias are number three. I didn't walk around for long.    But what about ramen? Well, one of the highest ranked spots on tabelog (Japans answer to Yelp!) was Shamoji. The shop doesn't even register on any of the ramen ranking sites.  Rankings are a relative thing outside of the big cities.    Despite having some tasty chicken meatballs, this bowl was just another weak shio ramen. Shop signs boasted that it is all local chicken, but the only time I get excited about toppings is when they accentuate an awesome bowl. A boring bowl with some tasty つくね?

My ranking for the fourth week is as follows:    錦本店 - Nishiki, from up north in Akita Prefecture, brought an awesome bowl of thick niboshi tori paitain. Made with primo chickens (Akita is famous for their Hinai poultry) and primo niboshi (Akita is also famous for their seafood), this was probably the best local-flavor bowl of the show.    六厘舎 - Yes, Rokurinsha came with the same thing you can get 15 minutes away at their brick-and-mortar shop. But there is a reason Rokurinsha has been such a dominant force on the tsukemen scene; it is the perfect blend of thick pork and smoky fish. Homemade noodles put this one over the top. The plastic bowl knocked it down a notch.    中華蕎麦サンジ - Almost everything about Sanji's bowl was perfect. From the homemade noodles to the rich soup with just a touch of beef bones. Everything except the salsa. Who is that for?    ラーメン人生JET - Jet was super simple. Nothing but chicken went into that soup. Muslims and Jews rejoice, this simple bowl from Osaka is just what you need.    支那そばや - Shinasobaya's master, Sano-san, is a legend in the ramen world. So much so that he can kind of do whatever he wants at an event like this. This year, he chose ingredients from all over Japan; Shinshu pork, Usura salmon roe, and Kujo leek. The bowl didn't impress, though. The ikura fell off the noodles, and their flavor got washed away.  I feel bad giving this a low ranking, because Sano-san himself gave me a cell phone accessory strap when I met him.    麺屋 卓朗商店 - Takuro Shoten comes in unlucky last this week. Shio as a broth was way to thin, and lacking of much flavor. Yes, that is a syringe of basil puree in the middle. Yes, it was a goofy gimmick that ended up squirting all over the place. Good pork though.  Who will come out on top? Stay tuned!  ",

        "post": " 次郎長新千歳空港店    I had a day in Hokkaido. Rephrase that one; I had 12 hours in Hokkaido. Such is the nature of my weekend work. And such nature had me up north with exactly one hour of free time. One hour at the airport.    Luckily, Sapporo's New Chitose airport has enough to keep a foodie busy for hours. Hours of above-average chain shops representing all the famous Hokkaido cuisines. There is soup curry, crab, and about eight places that sell milk flavored ice cream, a sweet synonymous with the area. There is also a ramen stadium, bringing nine ramen shops into one convenient location.    I wanted miso, and Jirocho serves miso.    Famished as I was, the first few bites were great. As time went on, though, boredom set in.    I don't like to consider myself a miso elitist, but I'm consistently underwhelmed with the stuff I've had in Hokkaido. I'm looking for a Kururi impact, followed by the creamy aftertaste of Oyaji. The decadent broth of something like 3SO, with a solid all-round taste like Hanamichi.  Of course, in my seven years in Japan, I've only spent one night in Sapporo, so I'm still hopeful for the future.       Open from something like 10am to 10pm  ",

A Jirorian can pinpoint the minor differences between the Jiro branch in Nishi-Shinjuku and the Jiro branch in Kabukuicho, a five minute walk away. A Jirorian thinks that bean sprouts count as a healthy topping.    And when a new Jiro-style shop opens, I don't really care.  But when a Jiro-style shop called Buraian opens, I take note. Because that is my name! I'm Brian!    In typical Jiro-style fashion, a single shred of cabbage was the only spec of health in this bowl. In typical fashion, I felt like crap after eating it. In typical fashion, the soup is rich and porky and delicious.    Then I was hit was some of the best news of 2013.

Perfect timing to grab the most famous bowl in Aomori Prefecture.    I wasn't the first ramen nut to come to Nagao.    And some locals come here almost every week! There are bowls labeled with people's names all over the shop. If you sign up for a members card and get 1000 points, you get you own bowl. That's about 150 bowls. Dedication.    But I was just in town for a minute, with just enough time for one.  From the 裏メニュー, the secret menu. Sure, you can go with a standard item, like the light asari ramen, or even the heavier kotteri, bu if you ask for the ura-menu, you'll get the max amount of niboshi possible.  Nagao made their name with heavy niboshi flavors, a trend that is all the rage in Tokyo these days.    Intense.    The idea of dried sardines as the main flavor in a bowl of ramen might sound off-putting to some foodies. Sardines, of course, are one of the most fishy smelling flavors of the sea. But by drying them, and boiling them for just the right amount of time, you get a smoky richness that is unparalleled in the food world.  And due to strict laws about importing dried fish from Japan to America, you aren't likely to find a bowl like this anytime soon. As was explained to me, dried fish needs to have all the guts removed to make it into the States, an impossibility for niboshi. Take advantage if you are in Japan. And if you can't make it up to Aomori, Nagi in Shinjuku does a good one.

Araton is a shoyu ramen, not the miso that you would expect. They did, however, manage to impart some of the warming thickness that makes miso ramen such a wonderful thing up in the north.

Winter is a wonderful time for seafood in Japan, with fish taking on extra fat for the colder months. Subtle fish flavors can often be used in ramen, but I suppose Kawahara-san, the infamous guy behind the Ippudo empire, was looking for something with a bit more of a punch; octopus.    The soup; a light dashi made with copious amounts of dried octopus. The toppings; octopus wontons and an octopus meatball. The staff t-shirts; octopus themed.    Served in a hotpot, everything about this this bowl was simple and fragrant. Definitely falls in the gentei category, not something I would want to eat on a regular basis, but pretty much the perfect bowl on the coldest day of the year so far (chance of snow in Tokyo).    Dump in the side of octopus rice for more octopus goodness.    This event was packed! Perhaps it was due in part to Kawahara-san himself being there (check my facebook page for a photo). A smattering of B-list celebs were on hand, as well as ramen fans from all over the Kanto area.    Ippudo has quite a few branches in Tokyo, around Japan, and all over the world. Though they aren't the best in their field, they are consistently good, and you can pretty much be sure of a good bowl anytime you want.

Go ahead and read my positive review of that experience, then order what everyone else in the shop was eating; the normal ramen.    But when I mentioned to some fellow ramen nuts that I went, they were quick to ask if I ate the whole bowl. The whole bowl? Of course!    No, the whole bowl if their famous ほたるラーメン. Yes, it is on fire in the above photo. More about that in a sec.    And so now that I have been back, I can say, \"No. No I didn't.\"    The tencho looks like the kind of dude who would secretly relish in what was served.  You see, the hotaru ramen, or should I call it the firefly ramen, is dubbed the spiciest ramen in Tokyo.    The fire is courtesy of the vodka soaked butter (or is that butter soaked vodka). Coupled with a light miso base and raw, diced habanero peppers, this bowl is wonderful . . . to smell. The sweetness of the peppers, the slight mustiness of the miso, the butteriness of the, um, butter. But at the first sip, your mouth is engulfed by the heat.  I would have liked it if the chef removed the seeds, leaving only the orange flesh of one of the world's hottest peppers. Nope, seeds and all.    And this was just level 1. Five grams of habanero pepper. Feel free to kick it up to level 10 if you have something to prove. I searched on the internet, and one pepper is about five grams. If you can eat 10 habanero peppers, please let me buy you a drink.  I left the bowl as you see it, with just a couple sips and a couple bites taken. It hurt the next morning. My buddy ate it all.

        "post": " 八平    I had a free Saturday, the weather was good, and mega-countryside 江ざわ was still on my list after failing to eat there last year. I had the coordinates in my GPS, what could possibly go wrong?    The shop moved! Only a month ago, they packed up and moved. If you stand outside the new place, a standard, run-of-the-mill shokudo style restaurant, you are bound to meet at least a dozen people who had your idea of amazing tantanmen, but didn't get the news.    We were quite hungry after taking the long way from Tokyo to Chiba, and decided to grab a snack anyways. The fried chicken plate looked much better than it tasted. For those who are interested in talk about routes, you should take the Aqua Line. Or, take the C1 through Tokyo to the 7 to the Keiyo Road, because the C2 doesn't connect with the Keiyo Road route and you will have to go a bit out of your way. Just trust your GPS. Route talk over!  After some talk with the chicken-cook, we found that the new shop is only 40km away, which would probably take 30 minutes on Chiba's back roads. Thankfully we called them before we left. Sure enough, they were out of soup for the day. This was at noon. They open at 11. Crazy.    But I had an ace up my sleeve. Another potentially tasty countryside ramen shop to the north called Hachibei.    My Garmin GPS put us squarely in the middle of a rice paddy. After slowly circling the area for a few kliometers, we made it. It isn't easy to find, but when you finally turn down the correct driveway, you know you are at the right place.    Nice dog!    About 30 people waited in line at this little shack. Evidence of the success of Hachibei can be seen next door, at the owners brand new, multi-story house, overlooking the madness below.    This shops specialty is Ariran ramen. The story of Arirang is an interesting one. From the shop's site:  昔の峠越えというのは非常に困難で 元気を出さなければ越えられなかったはず  Basically, a famous folk song about the trials of crossing a difficult mountain pass. And sticking with the Japanese belief that garlic, onions, and spices give you stamina, it makes sense that a bowl of Ariran ramen would give you that extra push to make it to the other side.    Wow. Mounds of fresh garlic, onions, and spices went into this one. I've never come across a shoyu ramen with so many aromatic onions and garlic cooked into the soup. Kind of the perfect bowl after a day of riding.    The chashu is excellent, though I was still on the full side from all that fried chicken before.    And the noodles! Homemade and kind of perfect. My buddy Leo on the BMW said, as we waited, that he's not a fan of noodles that absorb the color of the soup. Hachibei changed his mind.    The road back was straight and fast, with just a little traffic in the tunnel under Tokyo Bay.  A solid ride for sure. I've got a jam-packed February, so it looks like the next ramen ride will be in March. And in case you were wondering, the KTM is the same one I had my accident on. If you look very closely you can see the only damage it sustained; a scratch. Wish I could have said the same for my leg!  Stay safe out there!

But the brains behind the business lives out near Fussa, about an hour from central Tokyo. Using his success in the more central branches, he recently opened a shop closer to home.    The finest noodles!  I was out here for a random, non-ramen related adventure, and stopping by El Dorado on the way home was no problem.    Homemade noodles are a standard at anything with the Jiraigen stamp on it.    As is simplicity. The menu is shio or shoyu. With an egg or without. Extra pork on request.    Fantastic, as expected. Always go for extra pork at a Jiraigen shop.    This one is much lighter than the other shops, without that heavy niboshi kick that I really like at Saikoro. But lacking the kick is no problem, and every customer in the shop crushed this bowl completely.    This shop is mere minutes from Yokotoa Air Base, so if any of my viewers are military men or women, check it out! I can't be sure, but it is probably better than the ramen on base!      東京都福生市福生867-7 Tokyo, Fussa-shi, Fussa 867-7 Closest station: Fussa  Open 12:00-2:30, there is a night menu but I can't find the hours  ",

This year's crop of winter limited bowls brought a lot of light flavors, with many shops using simple bowls to highlight fish toppings. Sou went a different route.    If this creation looks a bit on the decadent side, that is because if uses Beurre d'Echire. Considered the gold standard of fine French butter, Beurre d'Echire has probably never touched a bowl of ramen until now. Croissants and pastries, sure, but how does it sit with a light shio ramen?    Certainly rich. And with a slice of parma ham and a bit of lemon, this is about as far from ramen that you can get away with.    These limited bowls are fun, and I am happy that they exist . . . for a limited time. I'll be back for the regular bowl here, which is highly ranked among Tokyo's elite ramen shops.    And now I know about Beurre d'Echire, the 84% butterfat butter that I will be buttering my toast with from now on, once I can find it in the Tokyo capital.

If you are very nerdy about ramen, you will know that Nishio, part of the amazing Nagi group, closed his shop a while ago, and helped Kabochan open in his place. The coolest part of the story is that Kabochan was a complete ramen rookie. Just a guy who loved to eat the stuff.    The 5 seat shop was perfect for this type of endeavor, and Kabochan (that is the master's nickname) became a bit of a sleeper hit in town.  We (Hiroshi and I) arrived at the exact last minute.    We literally got the last bit of tare of the day. Today's seasoning brought to you buy some ultra-premium shoyu from Yamaroku, a famous brewer from Kagawa prefecture.    I miss this place. This 1-day collab bowl was made with ingredients from about 30 different prefectures in Japan. It was a veritable who's who of local goods. Konbo from Hokkaido. Chicken from Akita. Green onions from Kyoto. The list went on and on.    You see, I used to live around the corner, and popping in for a solid bowl was always an option. I'm now across town, with different local haunts.    Though it was dropping into single digit temperature outside, I had to try the waiting-in-line-special.    Fresh apple kakigori! And, yes, the apples were from Aomori, one of the most famous apple regions of Japan.

When the sky is clear, the views of Mt. Fuji and the ocean are spectacular. And though it is cold, it is always a great way to start the year with some friends.  And though the ramen was bad, the latte at the cafe was good, and the my friend's \"Mt Fuji curry\", though it looked like something left outside overnight, was pretty tasty.    From Odawara, next to the sea, you pay a 500 yen toll and ride one of the best roads in the area. About 1000 meters elevation gain. Here's a random video I found on YouTube:    But unlike that video, the recent cold left quite a bit of snow on the sides of the road, slowly melting, and giving a chance of black ice on the curves. So while sport bikes can really fly up this hill, today was a cautious ride.    Oh, man was this one bad. It tasted like it came from a can!    Upon further inspection, it totally did! Wow, I've never seen industrial sized cans of concentrated ramen soup before, in all my years of ramen hunting.    New Years resolution: no more bad ramen! Stay tuned, my next couple reviews break that tradition pretty quickly!    Thank you as always to everyone I ride with. Another New Years resolution is to kick the Ramen Riders into full swing, with some great riding and great eating.    And even an official logo!

That is a taste that your average American grows up with.    Shimo-Kitazawa doesn't have many ramen shops, so Soruto manages to get a nod from me.

Never judging a book by it's cover, I tried Tonta with an open mind.    Hey, not bad. The soup was rich and creamy. Other aspects of the bowl, like the noodles and toppings, fell flat. Chain-style.    I found out later that there are quite a few of these Tontas, many of them around the Tokyo area. Even a few at highway service areas.

The mail came back with:  坦々麺の「175°」か、 えびラーメンの「一幻総本店」か、 味噌ラーメンの「狼スープ」かな！ ススキノで深夜なら「信玄」も美味しいよ♪  I checked, and Okami Soup was open for another 30 minutes!    The taxi driver was insane, drifting around corners and overtaking slower drivers in the snow. A 15 minute drive took about five.    Aaaahhhhh! Disappointment. I paid the driver and decided to walk back to the station, head held low. Would my ramen adventure in Sapporo be a bust?    Apparently not. Menkoi had the look of a winner.    And though they are rather low on the rankings for the Japanese sites I use, they are one of the best for 食べログ.    The house specialty, shio butter ramen, blew away my expectations of what Hokkaido ramen means. All I hear is miso, miso, miso. And though miso ramen is good, it is often the buttery aspect of it that people rave about. Take away the miso, keep the excellent local butter, and we have a winner.  Does Hokkaido equal miso? Well, probably yes. But it doesn't mean that every bowl needs fermented bean paste.    Leaving the store, the master handed me an orange. Awesome.       北海道札幌市中央区南8条西2丁目2-52 Hokkaido, Sapporo-shi, Chuo-ku, Minami 8, Jonishi 2-2-52 Closest station: Susukino  Open 11:30-14:00, 19:00-3:00am No lunch on Sundays  ",

        "post": " 札幌ラーメン 熊吉 横丁本店    Maybe I never gave an explanation about my job in Japan and the relation to all these seemingly random non-Tokyo ramen adventures. The quick run-down is that I perform in children's shows that visit a different city each weekend. One weekend Nagoya, one weekend Aomori. The performance halls are everywhere, from Abashiri to Okinawa. Nice gig!  But the downside is that free time on a free trip is limited. Often we will fly up Saturday morning, perform, hop a train to the next city, and check into the hotel after 9pm. Sundays are almost always work, work, work, so my only chance to get out and eat is Saturday night.    So that's how I ended up at Sapporo's Raumen Yokocho (ramen alley) on one of the coldest weekends in January.    The ramen alley is described as either a great place for a bowl, or a tourist trap. Regardless, it is super convenient, and the shops are open late.    Or so I thought. I really wanted to go to Karyu, the only shop in the alley with a line, but they were closed for what looked like a family event. Too bad. Hey, that famous guy from TV went here!    The second choice was based purely on the kawaii factor; a cute piece of nori.    Yep, my performance partner and I ducked into Kumakichi because they bothered to print something on their seaweed.    If this bowl is any indication, the ramen alley is a tourist trap. A cheap bowl that did the trick (of making me less hungry), but that failed to impress.    Looks like the local idol group enjoyed their bowls, though.      北海道札幌市中央区南五条西3-8 元祖 Hokkaido, Sapporo-shi, Chuo-ku, Minami 5 Jonishi 3-8 Closest station: Sapporo  Open 12:00-2:00  ",

I don't understand the details of the difference, but apparently there is one between Jiro-style and Jiro inspired-style.    Regardless of nomenclature, this is a mega-popular shop. The second brand of nearby Itto, Toro (燈郎) is a play on the Japanese characters from Itto (一燈) and Jiro (二郎). Get what they did there?    The relatively new shop has been accepted by just about everyone in the know.    I'm admittedly not a fan of Jiro, or Jiro-kei, or Jiro-insupai-kei, but this one worked for me, thanks to some of the best pork east of the Tama river. Completely infused with whatever soy sauce mixture they cooked it in, this chashu falls apart with the slightest touch of your chopsticks.    But wait, there's more. The shop is known for another meat topping; steak! For a few hundred yen more, you can get an entire steak to go with your ramen. Arteries be damned!    Another plus here at Toro is that you can get a mini size bowl. 150g of noodles is hardly mini, but considering most Jiro, Jiro-kei, and Jiro-insupai-kei give you at least 300g, this is a big point for those with normal size appetites.    I've eaten a lot of Jiro style, and I always say that I don't like it, but then recommend the shop anyways. Just realize that this is an intense style of ramen that would probably be a huge hit in any college town in America, if it weren't for all the health code violations.

Here is a quick side-by-side comparison of the branch in LA and the branch in Kojimachi.    Can you tell which is which?    Very different tastes. Expect heavier dried fish flavors in Tokyo, while the LA version was doing more with the pork.    The line in LA can be much longer, though that might just be a cultural thing. The 99% salaryman crowd in Kojimachi didn't linger with their bowls. The hip, LA crowd sat around for a while, ate half a bowl, and took the rest to go.  Yeah, you can get a ramen doggy bag at the LA shop.    Short review? Yep. The ramen scene in LA is still small. You should go if you live out there. This is a must-slurp bowl, at least until something better comes along.    The Tokyo branch, not so much. Very run of the mill, in my opinion, though the general consensus is positive.

        "post": " Ramen Shop    At the time of writing, there were only three ramen-related things I was interested in in America. The first was the Ramen Burger, that crazy food-fusion that hit New York by storm. But I am really only interested in eating it in New York, made by Keizo himself. So that one is tabled for the time being. Second was Ivan's shop, also in New York. Also out.  The third was Ramen Shop, the Oakland eatery started last year by three ex-chefs from Chez Panisse. Ramen Shop has probably the most talked about west coast bowl, and I wanted to see what the fuss was all about.    The menu at Ramen Shop follows the current trend of most hot restaurants these days. Have your signature item, but supplement it with optional sides that end up becoming very un-optional. Add to that a full cocktail program and a waiting bar, and you are set. The food community is divided on this topic, with many wanting a more Japanese experience; get-in-get-out, eight seats, ramen only.    Ramen Shop is more like 60 seats, and I don't think anyone just pops in for a quick bowl.    The cocktail program is fantastic. Plenty of spirits from artisan distiller St. George, and four or five local micro brews on tap.    The non-ramen menu is an all over the place mix of Japanese inspired plates. Sure, living in Tokyo, these are all standard things we know and love, but my memories of Bay Area life are very much devoid of Japanese pickles.  For those keeping track, maybe I should quote the menu. Sansho cabbage, turmeric daikon, lime kohirabi, and Hainanese watermelon radish.    The spicy quid fried rice really showcases the Chez Panisse roots of this shop. Local Monterey squid that was more tender than even some of the best I've had at high end sushi shops in Japan. Remember that scene from Jiro Dreams of Sushi where they massage the octopus for hours? This was better.  Monterey Bay squid and pork fried rice with wild nettles, cilantro, and Siew's spicy shrimp-chili paste.    But what about the ramen!  I t is hard to give definitive opinions on the ramen at Ramen Shop, because the menu changes daily. On this particular night, French influences were high, and the ramen reflected that.    Asari shoyu ramen with braised and roasted duck, salt-cured egg, hedgehog mushrooms, scallions, frilly mustard greens, and Mendocino nori.  The duck shoyu was light and fresh, with the duck chasu being the highlight of a quality bowl. It should be noted that all noodles at Ramen Shop are made in house with a Japanese noodle machine brought over piece by piece from Sapporo, Japan. All noodles are great, on par with whatever you consider great noodles to be.  By the way, best nori ever.    Spicy tantanmen with ground pork belly, shoyu-marinated egg, miso-braised tripe, bok choy, cilantro, and shungiko.  The tantanmen is ridiculously popular. Both the group to my left and the group to my right were slurping down on it. It got the French treatment from the sous chef, with a bit of tripe served as a topping.    Excellent, but something was missing. Sansho, that Chinese numbing pepper that makes a heavy appearance in all my favorite Tokyo tantanmen spots. After inquiring, the waitress, a native of Nagoya, brought out a bowl of it. What a difference! Turns out they use it in some of the other dishes.  This night just have been due to the French-heavy theme of the night. Scouring the internet for other photos will show some much spicier looking bowls.    Black sesame ice cream sandwich with brown sugar cookies.  And there you have it. A clear winner out in the East Bay, if you don't mind the wait (a TON of negative reviews exists solely because of the one to two hour wait).

With the worst snowstorm in decades hitting Tokyo, we had some time before our flight. Three hour delays to be exact.    Kanpais were in order.    And a bit of the stinky stuff.    Hey, not bad!    Get the set, and dump the spicy roe and rice in your left over soup.  Look, this wasn't the best bowl out there, and it would certainly fail in any comparison to the yatai of Fukuoka, but in a pinch it was a memorable meal. Coupled with a few nama beers, and waiting for the snow to pass was no problem.      福岡県福岡市博多区下臼井767-1 福岡空港第2ターミナルビル3F Fukuoka Airport Terminal 2  Open 10:00-20:20  ",

I also learned that you should avoid the restaurants and go for street food. It seems like everyone and their obasans make their way to Nagasaki for this event. Expect a wait!    This year was a repeat of last, with a little less free time. Just enough time for my staff and I to gab dinner before heading to nearby Saga Prefecture.    I recommended Kosanro for their excellent champon, but we were told that during the event, only $50 courses were on offer. That, and an hour wait.  It might surprise you, but the average Japanese person despises long lines for food just as much as the average American. I made a vow years ago to keep my elitist foodie opinions to myself, and accepted that we were now going to the only place in Nagasaki without a line.    This is in the heart of Nagasaki's Chinatown. Being a San Francisco native, I can tell you one piece of advice; don't eat at empty Chinese restaurants!  But like I said, when I'm with a group of coworkers, I keep the opinions to myself.    Just smile politely, drink a lot of beer, and eat.    But this is Ramen Adventures, so I can be frank. Just accept your fate and wait for the good stuff. Otherwise, this will happen. Horaiken was garbage, and probably survives simply on the fact that it is next door to Kosanro, an excellent spot that always has a wait.

After over three hours, with non-ramen obligations on my schedule, I left, vowing to someday make it out to the regular shop in Shiki. As luck would have it, the TV shooting on this day would take us there.    Ms. Ueda is a bit of a draw. She has been likened to the kindly, yet stern Yubaba from Spirited Away, the magical Ghibili movie from 2001.    Tough as nails, it is fitting that this bowl gets the treatment it does.    The burning is a two part process. First, the shoyu tare is fried up in the bowls. Tare is the essence of ramen's flavor, so you can imagine how burning it to a crisp would make this an intense bowl. Second, the broth is added with a bit more oil than average on top. Again, you are witness to an intense pyrotechnics show.    The result is flavorful, deep, and smoky. Also, burning oil is hot. Take care!  Shiki isn't far from Tokyo proper; just about 20 minutes from Ikebukuro. Ramen fans could easily have a day of ramen hunting up this way. Kawagoe is also nearby, with plenty of great shops like Ganja.    Official Site Here    埼玉県新座市東北2-12-7 Saitama-ken, Niza-shi, Tohoku 2-12-7 Closest station: Shiki  Open 11:00-16:30 Closed Mondays  ",

To eat ramen, of course!    Though no one believed my white lie (I was actually here for other work), a well-dressed gentleman with a gorgeous Leica camera spoke up. Chikutei is his go-to ramen in town.  This was at about 12:30, and Chikutei closes at 1am. Perfect.    Though the noren banner was down, indicating that they were done with service for the day, the lights were on and the master let me in for the last bowl of the day.  Strictly standard, though I could see this being a local's favorite ramen joint. The shop had just enough counter seating for the quick diner, and a tatami dinning room for long-stay drinkers or families. The bowl itself was a chickeny Chinese style that went down smooth.    Random autographs on the wall featured a plate written in English from 2006 from a famous octopus researcher.    How about more recommendations from locals? If you only have an hour to spare, take the boat around the castle moat. We had exactly two hours before our airport bus was due. An elderly boat driver was happy to drop us off near a local soba house.    Soba noodles in a light duck broth.    Tempura bamboo shoots, picked the day before in the restaurants backyard forest. If I were to rank non-ramen food, this would be in the top three of 2014.    Soup-less soba with all the fixings.  Although I wasn't too impressed with the ramen scene here in Matsue, the town itself should be on anyone's list if they plan on hitting the northern coast of Shimane and Tottori.

Chain ramen shops, family restaurants (i.e. Denny's), Chinese dives, and in this case, Korean barbecue. Usually these outlying ramen shops don't make it to Ramen Adventures, because, well, they tend to suck.    Sumiya, a nondescript Korean barbecue place a few stops out of Shinjuku, proved me wrong.  The word 〆 (shime) can be added to the front of a menu item to indicate that it is something to be eaten after the rest of the food. In this case, the shimenoramen in question is an insanely kodawari bowl made with freshwater clams from Lake Jusanko in Aomori, breaking all stereotypes that non-ramen-shop ramen is bad.    Usually reserved for high end bowls of miso soup, these are some of the best of the best in Japan. Add to that noodles from Shimane Prefecture, and a simple Japanese broth made from high quality konbu and katsuo, and this was the ultimate shime after some fatty cuts of prime beef.    Apologies for forgetting to take shots of the meat. We were filming for an upcoming episode of オスカルX21! and I didn't have time to get the camera out. On air May 9th!    Wow, I was shocked by this bowl. Most of the time, shime ramen just means that you dump noodles into a pot of whatever was eaten before. Usually leftover soup in a hot pot type of dish. Most of the time, shime ramen is just a delivery method to get some post-meat carbs.    Shockingly good. The shop's meat specialty is a cut of A5 wagyu with garlic butter. This simple bowl was an excellent refresher.    The master was happy to show off the konbu, from the far reaches of Hokkaido, bought at tsukiji fish market.    With only enough seating for about 10 people, you might want to call ahead.      東京都中野区沼袋4-32-6 Tokyo, Nakano-ku, Numabukuro 4-32-6 Closest station: Numabukuro  Open 6:00pm until late Closed Mondays and Tuesdays   ",

A few solid standards and some unique bowls as well.    Mushrooms are a theme, both in the decor and the bowls.    The chef's station is chock full of bits and pieces. To be specific, the regular menu offers a niboshi shoyu, a shio, a mushroom veggie soba, and a niku soba. That is just the regular menu. Expect limited bowls to be a normal thing.    The bowl of standard shio was, without a doubt, great. I'm, in general, not a huge shio fan, so I'm sure the rest of the menu will impress as well.    For an extra 150 yen, the shop has a fresh fruit smoothie. It was . . . healthy?    Bonus! I managed to go there again before posting.    The mushroom veggie-soba is on the crazy side. In the bowl - tofu, fried cheese, parma ham, chicken chashu, all in a cream of mushroom soup. Interesting. I prefer the original shop's veggie offering, but this one will do, especially if you are a mushroom fan.  Just about two minutes from the original shop.

        "post": " ソラノイロ    Here it is folks. Vegan, gluten-free ramen. In Tokyo.  Well, it comes as no surprise. With the global ramen trend showing no signs of stopping, the general global food trends are sure to interfere. And after Soranoiro's master Miyajima-san was invited to Paris Ramen Week, he caved!    I shouldn't be so harsh, as the vegan option is simply an addition to Soranoiro's excellent menu.    Let's get the criticism out of the way first. The noodles.    Ramen, by definition, is made using wheat noodles. Last I checked, wheat was not gluten free. But rice noodles are. So this dish makes use of pho noodles.  You're actually given a choice. If you can deal with gluten, the shop's standard paprika-enhanced noodles are used.    And now for the positive; the soup. The soup is a simple puree of carrots and cabbage, topped with fresh vegetables. As far as vegetable soups go, this one is a winner. Sure, the shop's Veggie Soba is better, using a tare rich with the umami flavors of clams and dried mackerel, but if those things are off your list, the simple shio tare in the vegan bowl isn't much of a compromise.    Japan is very tough to live as a vegan. Many chefs don't understand what vegan is, and you can expect to find fish, definitely eggs and dairy, in many dishes considered meat-free.  I'd be very curious to hear from some of my meat-free readers (do you even exist?) about this bowl. How does it look?  Original Review Here  ",

I've seen this label applied to ramen in the past, but still don't really understand the meaning.    Maybe it means that the shop is a notch above the rest of the Chinese restaurants that dot every city in Japan. The noodles are all made by hand using the old \"bamboo\" method, where the noodle master basically jumps up and down on a bamboo pole to knead the dough.  They weren't making noodles at the time I went, unfortunately.    These were good noodle for sure.    Coupled with some of the shops limited kakuni - stewed pork - this was one of the most epic post-motorcycle ride bowl I've had.    Hit the spot is an understatement. Tender and sweet, I could snack on this stuff all day. And it sure beats the convenience store food that we tend to eat too much of on our rides.    I'd never been to this station before, but it is packed. Turns out anyone going to touristy Hakone passes through here. Good to know.

        "post": " もり家    Udon?!?! But this is a ramen blog! What gives?    In the epic battle for noodle supremacy, ramen and udon are neck and neck, trading blows and refusing to allow a victor.  Not really.  But this is Kagawa Prefecture, home of Sanuki Udon, and Ramen Adventures is now Noodle Adventures, for a day at least.    Takamatsu city is a truly excellent place for bicycles. The sidewalks are relatively wide enough for riding, and the city-wide rental system is fantastic. Grab a bike from any of the dozen or so lots, pay 100 yen (about a buck), and return said bicycle anywhere.    Why am I even mentioning this bit of random travel info? Well, the noodle adventure was big this time around.  I inquired with those in the know about the best place for udon in Takamatsu. This is the biggest city in Kagawa Prefectures, a part of Japan also known as Sanuki. And if that name sounds familiar, it is because Sanuki is synonymous with the tasty wheat and clean spring water used in udon noodles. No one holds even a close second to the thick cut local udon of Sanuki.  Moriya was the number one choice from both a couple Tokyo based foodies and some local SHikoku fishcake makers.  Taxi drivers were also big fans, and will happily drive you to the shop; to the tune of about $50. Yeah, this udon shop is over half an hour drive from the station.  To make a long story short, I rented one of those 100 yen basket-bikes and rode for an hour and a half, up into the hills of Sanuki, for the best udon in Kagawa. And since the udon is Kagawa is the best in Japan, Moriya could be argued to be the best udon shop in the world.    Epic. This was, unfortunately, a national holiday. Over 100 people waiting in line meant a two hour wait.    A wait well into the evening.    Mention Moriya to a native and they will probably remark about the kakiage udon. Kakiage is a tempura fritter made of skinny slices of vegetables, shrimp, and whatever the shop feels will match well.    Moriya's kakiage is full of shrimp and Japanese pumpkin. Many people (myself included) find kakiage to be heavy on the onions, but Moriya struck a perfect balance.    And the noodles. Of course, these were the main draw. Hand-cut from the dough a few minutes before being cooked means a lot of bite, and a chewiness that makes udon feel more like a protein than a carb.  I regret not getting another bowl.    Ninety minutes there, the same back, and about two hours waiting. Was this bowl of noodles worth a five hour adventure? You bet it was.  I love Shikoku, but I'm probably never coming here without my motorcycle again!

Well, if this was just a bowl of ramen, just some food in any-ville, Japan, I would probably say no.  But I digress. This is an awesome shop.    The overhang outside boasts chukasoba, oden, deep fried skewers, and chicken feet, and lists three kinds of shochu alcohol by name. Not your typical ramen shop.    Sure enough, this is a grimy place that locals come to drink and snack on the cheap.    The non-ramen menu is huge. Tempura, homemade croquettes, kimchi-pork stir-fries. The list goes on. Outside the shop, today's specials featured whale sashimi and a raw horse platter.    Oden in droves. All of it was excellent. Keep in mind that this place is a serious dive. You'll be sandwiched in with the locals, and the amount of cigarette smoke was high.    And the ramen. This ramen is, well, interesting. Very sweet, to the point that it wouldn't stand on its own. After a few plates of oden, and a few glasses of local spirits, though, this bowl works. Almost a desert ramen, if such a thing exists.    By the way, they offer a mini-size bowl. Go for that one.

Bars, small izakayas, $5 pizza joints; hanging out in Hatagaya always feels right.  And to add to the general awesomeness of the area, they have a food event every month!    A one coin festival. The concept is simple; about 40 local shops offer a drink and snack for 500 yen. Just grab a map at any of the participating shops (or check the website) and go. You can easily spend the entire day bouncing around, drinking and eating and discovering the town.    Of course, there is a point card as well.  On this day, the Half Moon Club, what I always thought was a normal bar, had ramen on the menu. 500 yen for ramen? Definitely.    What a shop! Model guns and erotic art.    Some sort of theme? Not as far as I can tell.    Well, the ramen wasn't the best in town, but it was certainly a nice buffer between other shops on our 1-coin adventure.    Deep-fried skewers and a beer? 500 yen.    Sparkling rose and a fancy salad? 500 yen.    Not pictured: wagyu skewers, Thai curry, fried chicken, and sashimi.  See you next month!    東京都渋谷区幡ヶ谷２－８－１５ Tokyo, Shibuya, Hatagaya, 2−8−15 Closest station: Hatagaya  Open 7:00pm - 3:00am Closed Sundays  ",

And though recent years have seen the ramen war being fought on a much grander scale, it is still nice to find a winner in this part of town.    The niboshisoba at Ozeki is a light, pure blend of smoky dried fish from around Japan. This style has been done to death lately, but Ozeki seems to be a little more no-nonsense than a lot of contenders.    Simple and smooth. This is the ultimate after-drinking ramen. Just a minute walk from one of my favorite Tokyo cocktail bars.    Chukasoba and a creamy chicken soup are also on the menu, and both have been praised as well.

The concept here is thick miso with homemade noodles. And though that is nothing new, Tsunagi drops in a healthy, or unhealthy depending on your views, serving of seabura in the mix. Seabura, pork back fat.    With a slightly sweet blend of six types of miso, this is a flavor-rich bowl.    If you aren't getting enough stimulation from the sweet broth, chewy noodles, and silky back fat, go ahead and add some sansho, Chinese numbing pepper.    Great stuff, and all those toppings (extra pork, egg, extra nori) only cost an extra 200 yen. That's a steal!    Unique bowls like this are gems. While most miso ramen can be expected to taste a certain way, Tsunagi goes for something unique, and really brings it.    Nice work, Takahashi-san!

One of the staff is Miura's younger brother. The shop used to belong to Miura's father; an old monja-yaki joint.    And, with anything connected to Kikanbo and their crazy spicy noodles, you can expect some heat at this one.    Similar to the miso spice at Kikanbo, but ultimately unique. This one is more inspired by Indian flavors, while retaining that Kikanbo charm.    The spice levels are fantastic. Since the shop opened in May of 2014, they have only had one menu item, with one level of spice. Word is that the future will offer stronger and maybe weaker options. For now, though, anyone with even the most minute love of spice should check this one out.    A big winner in the spicy genre of ramen in Tokyo.    And . . . the swastika. Hopefully, readers of Ramen Adventures know that this symbol exists outside of the well known Aryan one.  The shop is adorned with hand crafted gold swastikas on a black background. Striking. One of the most beautiful shops I've been to.    What's this?    Now that's dedication! Ohashi-san is one of those workaholic ramen shop masters that slave for their craft. Days off?

Ramen nerds rejoice, ramen nerds lament. The original Machida shop of 69 'N' Roll One was epic. Then they shut down to move to greener pastures in Akasaka, and their quality suffered. I'm sure there is a lot more going on here, some behind-the-scenes ramen drama (dra-men?). Speculation, as I have no knowledge of why one of the best ramen shops in the world suddenly disappeared.    It would make sense that those who worked at 69 'N' Roll would go on to do their own great things. Toy Box is a perfect example. Yamagami-san crafted his skills, and now has Toy Box to show for it.    Shoyu, shio, and an aburasoba made with chicken oil. The shop also has a miso ramen that comes and goes.    Chicken oil is a tough ingredient. It can ruin anything it touches, and a delicate balance is needed. Only a few shops really work wonders with this ingredient. Saikoro comes to mind.    The aburasoba is a tasty mess of oil, flavor, an noodles.    But it is the shoyu that really shines.  Shoyu that is definitely a cousin of the award wining Rock and Roll ramen. Deep soy flavors and perfectly cooked toppings.    Worth a trek to the eastern reaches of Tokyo.

However, getting there is an adventure in itself.    The Toden Arakawa Line (都電荒川線). Even though I've been a Tokyo resident for a number of years, I've never set foot on the famed relic of Tokyo's former streetcar system.    It would be in poor taste for this ramen-nerd to talk trash about trains, so I'll counter the comment that this is the slowest method of transport I've ever seen (I think I could have run some stretches in less time) with the fact that riding it end-to-end will show you a fantastic side of Tokyo you'd never see from the subway.    And if you come in May, the whole track is covered with roses! How random!    On to the ramen.    1/20 is your standard new-style bowl. Rich in niboshi and chicken flavors, with a nice umami kick from the tare. Digging into the secret ingredients, you'll find sakura ebi, little pink shrimp that kick things up.    The real draw is what goes on top. Slow cooked pork chashu, tender chicken chashu, and hearty duck chashu. Yeah, that trifecta of roasted meats put 1/20 on my list of recommended shops.

I had some once and it wasn't something I would be rushing to do again anytime soon. Soggy noodles, strange toppings, and a weak soup. I expected Hulu-lu to either be some sort of saimin thing, or I expected spam. Or pineapples.    What you get is a solid shoyu in the new style. Bits of fried onion highlight a mellow soup. Everything about this bowl is subtle and relaxing. How Hawaiian of them!    I have to mention the noodles. Made in the back by the master, they are firm and chewy. I was taken aback by how good they were. Siamin noodles are horribly soggy, so to have some perfectly cooked noodles was a surprise indeed.    Ikebukuro tends to be a bit rough around the edges, so this little oasis is a welcome addition to my recommended ramen list. Be warned, though, they run out of soup at times.    The spam. Yes, in Hawaiian fashion, there is spam. But not as a topping or ingredient in the soup. If you purchase the spam set (you should), you get a wonderful spam rice ball. Filled with konbu seaweed and a shiso leaf. It is even wrapped in plastic, so you can take it with you and have it later. Give it a try!    Mahalo Hulu-lu!

And let me tell you, after four hours of that kind of work, you build up quite an appetite.  Luckily, within a 500 meter radius of the campus, there are dozens of ramen shops.    Tsubomi (lit. flower bud) has an odd theme going on. Did you spot it in the photo above?    There are some random Evangelion themed signs scattered about, but that is about it for the tribute to one of the greatest anime series of all time.    I'll admit, I am into quirky atmosphere, and would have really dug a shop that was over the top anime.    The ramen? A hearty tonkotsu shoyu that felt to be 100% Yokahama style, though the shop isn't an ie-kei ramen joint.  By the way, you will stink after this one.

Apparently the foodie community took offense, and I was quickly schooled as to where the better noodles in town are.    Schooled indeed. Hashizune is what I expected of a noodle shop in the high-rent side of town. Elegant design (you might think it was a nice sushi-ya at first glance), plenty of extras on the menu, and quality drinks. More on those in a minute.  Above is the noodle menu for the day. Shark fin, Hong Kong style paikomen, and the simple steamed chicken with negi oil all looked good.    This shop is an extension of Shinagawa-based Hashizume Seimen noodle factory. Expect a choice of specialty noodles with any order. Today's selection was:  ごぼう - Gobo is burdock root モロヘイヤ - Mulukhiyah is a kind of Middle Eastern herb こしょう - Pepper 花椒 - Kasho, or Sichuan pepper とまと - Tomato    The staff recommended the chicken. I chose the kansho noodles for a bit of kick to match the simple soup. An excellent all around bowl; nice wafu flavors with tender steamed chicken and crispy cabbage. I'll be back for some of their other dishes soon.  The noodles were very good, as expected from a long-running noodle factory.    Hashizume can be affordable, as the noodles are in the 1000 to 1500 yen price range. Certainly above average, but nothing outrageous (though the shark fin ramen was 2400 yen). Of course, if you start ordering off the side menu, prices can get a little high. Having just finished work, a little Japanese sake was in order. A nice offering from Shimane Prefecture.    After the noodles, I still had a bit of nihonshu left, so I tried to order a small appetizer to match my sake. However, with a slight grammar error on my part, instead of ordering \"An appetizer that matches well with this sake,\" I ordered \"An appetizer and another order of this sake.\"  Oops!

        "post": " 満月    The roots of Sakata ramen date back to the end of the Taisho era, sometime in the 1920s. It is a simple story; a Chinese guy's ramen was popular, and spawned a slew of related shops. Fun fact, the original Sakata shop was called 三日月軒, and most shops in town show their respect by including the 月 character in their name. More (not much more though) history can be seen in Japanese over at official Sakata site.    I was thinking of forgoing a second bowl, but the massive line outside Mangetsu was begging to be waited in.    Despite about 15 people ahead of me, the line moved fast. Random sight of the day, I watched as a man and his young son stole the ramen map out of the basket of my rented bicycle! I had an extra copy in my bag, and it was free, but still, that was a first!    If you were expecting anything but fishy soup, you'd be wrong.    More of the same.    I really, really liked the vibe at these shops. Locals and tourists all relaxing together. The shops are obviously family run, and the walls are adorned with children's photos and drawings. Community feels strong here.    But I just can't get over the taste. Funky-fishy flavors that, if turned up a couple more notches, would be right at home on an Andrew Zimmern TV show.    Sorry, I have to be honest here on Ramen Adventures.    With some time to spare, I followed the tour buses to see the rest of the town.    From the old warehouses . . .  . . . to $400 a kilo cherries. Yamagata, you're crazy!

        "post": " 花鳥風月    Ah, obscure ramen towns across Japan, how you tempt me. One such town is Sakata, north of Tokyo in Yamagata Prefecture.  Sakata ramen! Let the adventure begin!    I've worked up here before. Usually, my company sends us the day before, but for some reason opted for an 8am train up into Yamagata Perfecture via Niigata. Five hours later, and we would only have a couple minutes of free time. Followed by work. Followed by a taxi to the airport and a quick flight home.  So I did what any ramen hunter would do . . . stayed up all night and took the 6am train!    Ugh. Plans for blissful slumber on the shinkansen didn't work as well as I had hoped. Can we get some comfortable seats to Niigata? The new E5 and E6 trains to Tohoku are much nicer. I'm looking forward to the new E7 as well, I'm guessing it is on the luxurious side. But enough about trains.  What is up with Sakata?    Free bicycle rentals at the station, that's what's up!    This is countryside Japan, and things are spread out. Hours of walking were mitigated to minutes, thanks to my trusty mama-chari. Or maybe I should say rusty mama-chari. But free is free!  And thanks to the free ramen map from the station, I only got lost twice on my way!    Sakata ramen at last.  Sakata ramen's soup is heavy on the fish. Here, flying fish, mackerel, sardines, and skipjack tuna. No subtle flavors going on here, this is some in-your-face fishy stuff. Historically, Sakata was a thriving port city, with local fishermen using it as their port for unloading the hulls.  Kachofugetsu adds shrimp wontons for a unique bowl.    Honestly, though, I wasn't feeling this one. The mega-fishiness would have worked better as a late-night bowl than an 11am one.    This shop, as well as the next one I would go to, were packed with people, it should be noted.

Pork bones and lamb bones make the soup, and the lamb chashu rounds out the unique character of this one.    Lamb is a funky little meat, but works when balanced with the other ingredients.    Of course, as with all Mensho things, noodles are made in house.    And researched in the laboratory.  A laboratory?

        "post": " 小豆島ラーメン HISHIO    My travels take me all over Japan, and when I heard that a good friend had moved to Shodoshima, a small island between Okayama and Kagawa in the Seto Inland Sea, I made plans to visit. Shodoshima is famous for their traditional shoyu brewers, and many top shops in Tokyo use craft soy sauce from this remote part of the country.    Hishio (醤), which is one way to pronounce the sho in shoyu, is the go-to ramen shop on the island. They use as much local goods as possible, taking amazing Seto dried sardines and matching that with the deep shoyu that you expect.    Coupled with veranda with a sea-side view (come for lunch for the view), and you have a perfect spot to break a 10 day ramen dry spell that I was on.    Fantastic. The soup is thick and intense, and resembles Wakayama ramen in a sense. A crazy shoyu impact, as expected.    The hishio set comes with a tasty rice bowl on the side.    Another hit with this shop is the free 替え玉 policy. You want another serving of noodle? Eat as many as you like.    Though I found that the soup didn't retain the initial flavor with the kaedama.

Traditional Chinese characters for tantanmen anyone? 摊摊面 becomes 坦坦麺 becomes 坦々麺.    According to the aforementioned internet recommendation, the staff all speak with a heavy Chongqing accent; a sure sign of authenticity.    Another authentic touch is the addition of dongcai, a mix of pickled cabbage and mustard greens. Dongcai (冬菜) is dark green, and I can't say that I've ever eaten it before (though I probably have).    Hmmmm . . . no dongcai. I guess they are under new management.    I wasn't too impressed with this one. It was generally good, though nowhere near the bowls I can get at many, many places in Tokyo.    As usual, it gets tastier as you get to the bottom.    Ah, a well written article on the internet that is, unfortunately, out of date. Such is the problem with modern China. Actually, this writeup will only be viewed illegally, as Ramen Adventures is on the Blogger platform, a site that is blocked by the Chinese government.

A direct flight from Kenya back to Tokyo was in the cards, until I read that travelers can get a free 72 hour transit visa in China. The perfect chance to crush a couple bowls of spicy tantanmen in the capital!    I donned my official World Cup 2014 Japan team jersey and set out on a rented bike for a tantanmen . . . sorry . . . dandanmian adventure!    Beijing is amazing by bicycle. The main roads all have dedicated bicycle lanes (though the black government Audis may butt in during heavy traffic). Jutting out like capillaries are the hutong, small streets lined with whatever wants to take up residence. Mostly homes, but a few tiny restaurants end up in the mix. Everything on the hutong feels hidden.  Zhang mama came recommended as a hidden gem.    Just look for the crowded hole-in-the-wall. I read that lines out the door are common, though this time I just had to walk in and push my way onto whatever table had a free chair.    Dandanmian and a beer. 13RMB. That's about two bucks for those budgeting their money.    Remember to mix it up. A big bite of the top will leave your mouth number from the lama, the sansho peppers that you had better love. The middle bite is nothing but noodles. And the bottom. The bottom is a fiery spice mix that required that beer.    Also in the self-service fridge are skewers of vegetables and animal parts, and something that looked like a yogurt drink.    Whatever the other tables were going for, it all looked great. Bowls of spicy oil for cooking the skewers, plates of brown-colored meats and tofu, and lots and lots of noodles.    The flavors get deeper and deeper as you slowly work to the bottom. Power through it, the pain was only temporary. And though I dig the kodawari style of Japanese tantanmen, with more complex undertones, this bowl of the real stuff was solid.       东城区分司厅胡同4号(安定门内大街西侧) Dongcheng qu fen si ting hutong 4 hao (an ding men nei da jie xi ce) AnDingMen  ",

Occupying a corner wedge near the south side of the station, this little standing bar was packed with attractive young guys and girls, all who were stopping for a quick drink before starting work. Work at 10pm? Let your imagination run wild.  One stylish lady on her way to a job at a hostess club recommended Haruchan for a 500 yen bowl of tonkotsu ramen.  Yes ma'am!    Sure, this works.

After said minute, a very inebriated gentleman in grey walked out, looked down the street, and yelled at a guy in a garish multi-colored suit. \"Hey you sumabitch!\". Rainbow suit dude then ran over, uppercut the salaryman, and soccer ball kicked him in the back. The brawl continued, and soon the entire Obihiro police force was present.    Inside, the group of sauced ladies sitting next to me introduced themselves as kyodai. Oh, you all go to Kyoto Daigaku? Of course, kyodai means sisters, and these girls were definitely not Kyoto Dai material. My vocabulary slip made in impression on an older gentlemen sitting next to me, who proceeded to pay for everyone in the shop. I didn't look for the missing pinkie finger, but signs pointed to him being the boss. These are stories that only happen when alcohol is present.    But how was the ramen?  Well, I too was quite tipsy, so it was definitely one of the best bowls of the week. Smooth Hokkaido miso topped with a copious amount of seasoned pork. Just what was needed!

Often soupless, these creations can have anything in them, so long as they use cold ramen noodles. It is a great way to beat the heat.  Here are some 2014 bowls.    Kagari in Ginza served a tare jelly with smoked duck, scallops, scrambled egg, and a side of tomato.    Kikanbo in Kanda used a special aromatic sansho pepper from Okayama Prefecture to season the roast chicken, eggplant, and cherry tomatoes.    Senrigan was off the hook. The mound of moyashi bean sprouts was replaced with a daikon salad. Then drizzled with a sesame dressing. Then, as expected from Senrigan, drizzled with half a cup of pork back fat. Amazing.  ",

Simple; just fat, carbs, and salt.    The only thing it was missing was a nice, runny egg on top. By the way, the above shot is half-sized noodles, a request I made. Being a Jiro-inspired shop, you can expect a voluminous mass as standard.  Also, ninniku irimasu ka?

Remember, this is Hokkaido, and Hokkaido runs on Hokkaido-time. The elderly chef took his time, even stopping for a few minutes to chat with a family that wandered in. He had obviously known them many years ago, as the conversation was focused mainly on how big the daughter, now a college student, had become.  The soup is made in small batches. Four bowls at a time. The wok is thoroughly cleaned, and the prep starts again. There were at least eight people ahead of my order. If I missed this train, it was more than two hours until the next one. Hokkaido-style.    But sometimes you need to slow down. Not everything is a rush-hour frenzy to get in and out in record time. Here is a shop, where old friends come for a nostalgic meal, and everyone has a grin, and everything is right with the world.  I'm sure as hell not going to upset this balance by encouraging the chef to pick up his pace.    The ramen was good, surprisingly so. Just enough homemade curry paste mixed with the thick soup. Nothing as epic as Sapporo miso, but I have to give it to Muroran and their 4th Hokkaido style.  Slurping at maximum speed, trying not to splash the potent curry soup on my clean shirt, I finished the last of the noodles, and drank as much of that amazing curry as possible. Then I ran.    Time to spare!    A successful ramen adventure indeed!

But, like many random corners of Japan, Muroran has a history of ramen.    Created in 1965 by the shop Ajinodaio, the curry ramen here reflects the naval connections of the port city. Many ports in Japan boast some sort of curry, as curry was a sailor's staple. And though the curry ramen in Muroran has withstood the test of time, it remained unknown to the rest of Japan until, in 2006, a large PR campaign was launched. The muroran kare ramen no kai, Muroran curry ramen group, set out to educate the country on Hokkaido's 4th ramen (after Sapporo miso, Asahikawa shoyu, and Hakodate shio).    Half real thing and half marketing, this led to too many curry ramen shops. I tried to go to the original, but they had run out of soup for the day. The next closest place to my hotel was Fuji Ramen.    Located in the middle of the red light district (another hobby of sailors worldwide) you'll find a few sushi shops and this curry ramen.  Nothing too special, as expected. Definitely not a bowl that would sell you on an entire style.  In Hokkaido ramenya style, Fuji Ramen serves plenty of other options. You aren't stuck with the curry; shoyu, shio, and miso are all there.      北海道室蘭市中島町1-15-20 Hokkaido, Muroran-shi, Nakajimacho 1-15-20 Closest station: Muroran  Open 19:00-3:00am Closed Sundays  ",

        "post": " 磯焼亭    On a whim I decided to trek to Rishiri Island, a remote spot that is a two hour ferry from Japan's northernmost point. The goal was to hike Rishirifuji mountain, one of Japan's 100 famous mountains. Rishiri (and neighboring Rebun) are known for three things. The first is the rain; these islands are magnets for foul weather. The rainwater flows down the steep mountain, collecting iron and other minerals, finally nourishing the second famous thing; kelp. Kelp from this part of Japan is some of the best, and chefs pay a premium to get their hands on it. Fine kaiseki cuisine in Kyoto? They are probably using Rebun konbu. The third thing that flourishes here is the uni. Sea urchins eat that kelp, and once again command a high price.    Notice that I didn't include ramen in that list?    Well, just across from the ferry terminal is a \"famous\" ramen shop. Famous in that it was on TV back in 2009.  This is an issue I have with local ramen in Japan. It is very easy to get your stuff on TV and then ride that wave. Food-related TV shows in Japan are generally 99% entertainment, and don't take anything seriously. It is all about the talento and their overreaction. That isn't to say that I don't love food-related programming. Just don't assume that because some cross-dressing 芸能人 or pop-star liked the food that it is good.    What about this one, dubbed Rishiri Ramen? I've gotta say no, but I will preface that with a yes. The one they are known for is a hot-mess of ocean-related toppings; shrimp, scallops, oysters, mussels. None of which were that good.    But, the one thing that was local, the kelp, was fantastic as a topping. There was another bowl on the menu, a simple kelp one without all the odd toppings, that I would recommend. It just melts into the soup, releasing massive amounts of umami and a fresh, oceany flavor.  I should also note that the shop serves unidon, bowls of rice topped with local sea urchins, that are fantastic (and spendy at around 4000 yen).      北海道利尻郡利尻富士町鴛泊字港町 Hokkaido, Rishiri-gun, Rishirifuji-cho, Oshidomari, Minatomachi Closest station: None.

A quick history of Asahikawa ramen:  Asahikawa created their own signature ramen style back in 1947, when Hachiya and Aoba started mixing pork and chicken bone soup with a lighter, fishy soup. While nowhere near as famous a style as Sapporo miso ramen, this is one of my favorite places to slurp. The ramen tends to be a bit intense up here in the north, just the way I like it. And while the original shops still command long lines, there are plenty of other top shops in Asahikawa. Tenkin tends to be many people's favorite.  But I've visited all of these shops. Time to hit the solid #4 in town.    Matsuda's tontoro chashumen comes in at a staggering 1200 yen. That's almost double what a normal bowl in Hokkaido costs.    But they've been serving this one for a while, and the masses have spoken with their wallets. This is a great bowl. Not as intense as Hachiya or Aoba, this one is the perfect backdrop for the chashu that makes Matsuda famous.    The thing you paid so much for is worth it. Pork that melts into the bowl. Almost impossible to pick up with your chopsticks.  This is tontoro, the fattiest pieces of meat. Taken from the jowl, this cut is often compared to fatty tuna. I don't know about that analogy, but it is definitely some of the best in town.    See you next year, Asahikawa!      北海道旭川市2条通6丁目 エンドレス26 1F Hokkaido, Asahikawa, Jodori 2-6  Open 11:00-4:00am  ",

It is also super cheap, and a group of any size can eat and drink for next-to-nothing. Yokocho, by the way, means alley.    A hidden gem, and the perfect place to kick it.

Once again I'm having an official Ramen Adventures Meetup!  What: The 2014 Grand Tsukemen Fest Where: Okubo Park (大久保公園) When: Sunday, October 19th from 7pm-9pm  Check the meetup link here:  http://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Ramen-Meetup/events/212504722/?a=ra1_te  RSVP and tell a friend. Anyone is welcome!    The event is on from October 2nd to 29th, every day, so feel free to check it out when you have time. Each week, from Thursday, six new shops from all over Japan come to showcase what they can do with tsukemen.    I couldn't make the first week, but here are some impressions from week two.    Junk Story, a shop from Osaka, killed it with this one. Simple and intense, you can't go wrong with a solid tonkotsu gyokai toripaitan soup.    Otodo, the 3rd place winner from last year, topped themselves with this one. A heavy chicken soup with plenty of great toppings.    Strike, another Osaka shop, made a light toripaitan that was the surprise of the day. Very refreshing.  Also, they have the best T-Shirt of the event! Go Raiders!    Gonokamisuisan made an interesting gindama, sablefish, soup that was on the fishy side, but excellent when piping hot.    I hope to see some of you at the meetup on October 19th!  http://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Ramen-Meetup/events/212504722/?a=ra1_te http://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Ramen-Meetup/events/212504722/?a=ra1_te http://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-Ramen-Meetup/events/212504722/?a=ra1_te  ",

The problem, though, is that sometimes the Hatagaya Yahiko shop is also Dokkan. And if you are craving Dokkan, then chances are it is Gamushara that day.  Yes, the shop changes menu depending on the day and time.    Fret not, though, as last year the master opened a stand-alone Dokkan just west of Hattagaya. And now they have opened a stand-alone Yahiko-style shop. While one shop with three facades was fun, three shops is much better.    Just as the original, there are plenty of savory toppings to choose from.    Pretty much the same deal. I'll admit, I am biased towards the original location, probably because Hatagaya is one of my favorite drinking spots in Tokyo, and a trip to Yahiko/Dokkan/Gamushara is often preceded by good times.    The location is great, as well. Right next to beautiful Shinjuku-gyoen park and the Takashima department store. Something for everyone!  I made a video with #TokyExtra.

Ramen Adventures could be devoted to only Niigata (if I lived up there of course).    The above free flyer features only a handful of the shops around Nagaoka Station.  Of course, Niigata isn't Tokyo, and a deep ramen search requires a car or bike. With just a few hours in town, I had no plans to go deep. The highest ranked shop within walking distance of the station was Anbuketei, a biker-friendly bowl that specializes in the Tsubame-Sanjo style.    Tsubame-Sanjo means thick noodles, thick soup, and plenty of seabura back fat.    Intense.    Definitely a quality slurp, and the shop was full of children and the elderly alike. At one point, a spontaneous \"Gochisosama!\" (thank you for the meal) screaming contest erupted from a particularly large group of five-year-olds, much to the amusement of everyone present.  If you live in Tokyo and want the equivalent, Dokkan has you covered.    This isn't a bowl that the average ramen fan would finish. Simply slurping all the noodles and eating all the excellent chashu is enough.      新潟県長岡市柏町1-2-18 Niigata-ken, Nagaoka-shi, Kashiwacho 1-2-18 Closest station: Nagaoka  Open 11:00-20:30 Closed Mondays and some Sundays  ",

Neat! It turned out to be a great bowl. The flavors were solid, with nothing crazy, and nothing intense.    Of course, you should pick the longest line, right?    The Fukushima toripaitan sold over 8000 bowls at a regional ramen fest, and was finally making the trek down to Tokyo.    The Tokyo Ramen Show is all about collaboration bowls.    This one between Matador and Kuroki brought two of my favorite shops together, though the result was 95% Matador.    I was a bit rushed when I went, so didn't have a chance to get too deep into the mix this year. Did anyone go there? I'd love to hear your impressions.  Official Site Here.

        "post": "  ラー麺ずんどう屋 東京新宿店        I shy away from large chain shops, and cautiously approach the smaller ones. Zundoya could be classified as a mini-chain, with about a dozen shops in Kansai (Western Japan), a new shop in Tokyo, and a future shop in New York.        New York you say?         Yep, with a shop opening in 2015 in the heart of Manhattan, Zundoya is setting their sights high. Could this be the Ippudo killer?  At first glance, the shop is very Ippudo-esque. A creamy tonkotsu soup, straight noodles, Kyushu-style toppings. Even the red bowls look to be aimed at Ippudo's style. But Zundoya is its own beast, pushed to another level by the addition of seabura, glistening globs of pork back fat. Choose your level.  Go strong. Ask for こってり味 - kotteri aji - for a big hit of fat. Or go for 背脂まみれ味 - seabura mamire aji - smeared with fat - if you want.         For me, I was always surprised by the way Ippudo was received in America. In Japan, I'll casually walk into an Ippudo, grab a cheap bowl and a beer, and leave 15 minutes later being satisfied. The insanity of the New York Ippudo, with hour waits and high prices, never felt right.  Zundoya feels to me the same way. This is a bowl I could jump into anytime. No fussing. Just a solid bowl of ramen. Will it suffer the same fate / fortune as Ippudo? We'll know next year.

You have from left to right and top to bottom, dried fish, shrimp, and crab (and a beer).    The chef recommended the shrimp.    A decent bowl, accented with a healthy serving of fresh baby shrimp. It was, though, lacking some kick.    Good thing they have a homemade spice blend. Take pepper, sansho, and a bunch of secret stuff, and you have exactly what this bowl needs. Use a lot of it.

Despite having a list of far-off shops to trek to, Yotsuba was just up the road in Saitama. And Yotsuba commands an insane score of 97.6 at the ramen database. That puts it at #3 in the country for new shops.    We had to go. It isn't even that far. But due to it being the start of a long weekend, the traffic just to get out there made it feel like a trek. Ugh, I can't begin to describe how bad traffic in Japan can get.  We arrived at the spot, somewhere along national route 254, somewhere in the middle of rice paddies and factories.    There it is. We sampled both the ramen and the mazesoba. Both are top notch, with copious amounts of slow-cooked pork and solid noodles.    Both also remind me specifically of Mugitooribu in Ginza. Actually, it reminds me so much of their soup blend (also a mix of chicken and clams) that I would say, unless you are a motorcycle rider with plans to be in the area, you might want to give this one a miss.  I'm conflicted.  If you live in Saitama, this one might be closer.    The shop is also a sushi-ya. I believe the story is that the ramen master's father made sushi here for some years. Keeping with the roots of the shop, there will be a daily nigiri that you can order. The aji - horse mackerel - of the day was excellent.

Miso ramen's history dates back to 1955, when a customer asked for noodles in his miso/pork soup. Since then, Sapporo has been synonymous with miso ramen. But, truth be told, my limited excursions into the far north have had less than stellar results. Bowls were mediocre, while the miso ramen joints in Tokyo that I frequent really shine.    Yukikaze is, of course, highly ranked and famous. This is usually a sign of greatness, but my skepticism is high when it comes to miso.    Taking the chance (a business trip sent me up here for the week), I waited in the long line, and ordered the most popular menu item. 濃厚味噌らーめん. Thick miso ramen.    Yes, yes! I wanted to shout out my praises in this silent shop. Silent because everyone is entranced by their bowl of miso perfection.    A secret blend of three misos, topped with just the right amount of high quality toppings. This bowl sits alongside the best of the best.  I dug the sprinkling of fried potato on the top, it added an extra kick of salt and texture that matches with that silky smooth soup.    As this random celebrity agrees!  (Actually, he isn't random, and he said the shio ramen was good. I'll be back to try it.)      北海道札幌市中央区南七条西4-2-6 LC拾壱番館 1F Hokkaido, Sapporo-shi, Chuo-ku, Minami 7, Nishi 4-2-6 Closest station: Susukino  Open 19:00-2:00am Closed Sundays  ",

Shiogawaya's master set out to use not only local Fukushima ingredients, but ingredients from friends and family. The pork is a specialty breed that is raised on a diet of エゴマ, a kind of wild sesame that is meant to give a nice flavor to the meat.    The tare is made by a high school friend of a friend.    And the noodles, of course, are made just down the road.  The pork was oddly lean compared with what you might find at other shops. I usually prefer a bit more marbled fat, but this was a nice change from the many, many bowls I've had in Kitakata. The recommended addition of wasabi was also a nice touch.    The same pork is used to make some fried メンチ - deep fried minced pork cutlets.  Kitakata is famous for the old buildings, and this shop is housed in a 100 year old warehouse. Great care was kept to keep it as original as possible. A beautiful shop, indeed.

Everything is bleached wood and subtle Japanese touches. A bright red maple tree was in full autumn foliage outside the front door.    Plenty to choose from, but the most popular is by far the Shio. Sorry, the Sio.    Simple. To be honest, I wasn't feeling this bowl as much as the others in Kitakata. Maybe it had to do with the fact that this was another 7am bowl, and the previous night had been fueled by Kitakata's other claim to fame, Japanese sake. In addition, this was my fourth bowl, having crushed three the day before. While some raota (ramen otaku) love competing in a Pokemon-esque contest to slurp-em-all, I'm content with one or two bowls a day at max.  This is probably the shop I will return to to sample again. Presentation was beautiful, and the ingredients were all top notch.    The shop has some local history.    And plenty of gifts to take home. Almost all Kitakata shops have take home sets. In a pinch, you could bypass the lines and grab a box or
 two to prepare at home.        福島県喜多方市関柴町上高額字境田635-7 Fukushima-ken, Kitakata-shi, Kamitakahitai, Sekishibamachi, Sakaida 635-7 Closest station: Kitakata  Open 7:00-19:00 Closed Fridays  ",

A sunny weekend in the autumn? Forty minutes wait.    We sampled everything. The miso.    The standard shoyu, par for Kitakata-style ramen.    The shio, using a light tare.    The spicy miso.    Great egg! Great chashu. Be sure you order extra.    Although they have options, I say go with the shoyu. While most shops are on the lighter side, Hasegawa is a bit more in-your-face.

Kitakata is a mecca for ramen lovers.  I've been to a few shops on my own over the past few years, always as some sort of side mission on a motorcycle trip. In no particular order:  Bannai Honten Ito Shanghai Shokudo Makoto Genraiken  Time to add six more to that list. Kitakata, according to local officials, has 122 different shops serving ramen. Yes, this town probably has the largest shop per person ratio in the country.    Kitakata is known for great bowls of asara - morning ramen. Quite a few of the city's 122 shops open for an early service around 7am. Not a bad way to start the day.    Asian Shokudo offers three choices for their soup; Golden-kei, Chacha-kei, and Gattsu-kei. As it was first thing in the morning, the lighter golden broth was the way to go.    Golden, indeed! A great morning bowl. Light, with just enough flavor to let you know that you are in one of Japan's most famous ramen towns. Excellent chashu pork that melts in your mouth.    Asian is right next door to another popular shop called Shanghai Shokudo. Which one should you choose? Why not have breakfast at Asian, walk around for a few hours, and have lunch at Shanghai? Sounds good to me!    The shop is a family affair, with husband and wife manning the kitchen. Even their young daughter helps out with dish washing (and slurping!)    Having slurped at 11 of Kitakata's 122 ramen shops, I can safely put Asian in the top five.      福島県喜多方市字二丁目4650-29 Fukushima-ken, Kitakata-shi, Nichome 4650-29 Closest station: Kitakata  Open 7:00-19:00 Closed Wednesdays  ",

The soup, 100% pork bones, is cooked for a day at high heat, resulting in a sludge that is pure pork heaven.    I finally made it to their tsukemen shop, located just a couple blocks away. Same deal, more-or-less, but this time the noodles are thicker.    Like the original, good stuff.    \"Hey ladies! The collagen from pork bones is super healthy for you!\"    Though Mukyoku is good, the original ramen shop is far above it. One reason is that the soup is all made over at the ramen shop. Watching them slosh around the giant vats of bones is an experience.

Not much of a trek, Higashi-Koganei is only about 20 minutes from Shinjuku, but a trek none-the-less.    In the year since opening, Kujira has been lauded by everyone. The recently released 2014 version of TRY (Tokyo Ramen of the Year) magazine puts them at the #2 overall best new shop. Not a bad way to start your shop's career.        The master, Shimomura-san, trained at one of my favorite shops, Shichisai, and serves up a very similar bowl. He even does a little 手もみ, hand massaging the noodles before cooking to give them a unique texture. This ten second smoosh cuts cooking time in half, and you'll be treated to a much chewier noodle.    A near perfect bowl of shoyu ramen.    When I take people to their first bowls of Japanese ramen, I usually start with this style. The flavors are familiar, but everything is elevated. Every bite is pure comfort, and drinking this bowl dry is no problem.    Many people live on the Chuo Line, the train line heading directly west out of Shinjuku, in more affordable neighborhoods. Not open for lunch, this is probably your best bet for an evening bowl.      東京都小金井市梶野町5-1-19 Tokyo, Koganei-shi, Kajinocho 5-1-19 Closest station: Higashikoganei  Open 18:00-1:00am Closed Sundays  ",

        "post": " Narumi Ippudo    Most everyone knows Ippudo. The small chain of shops in Japan exploded internationally in cities like New York and Singapore. It isn't a huge surprise, the ramen at Ippudo is great. So great that it has spun off some off-brand shops like an Ippudo miso shop and some Ippudo express shops at shopping malls around the country.    But when I heard about Ippudo opening a French inspired shop, I was baffled. What gives?    Well, this was all a result of an event in France in 2014; Paris Ramen Week. Paris Ramen Week brought some of Japan's top ramen chefs out for a week of popups, seminars, and general food fun. Some of the chefs were inspired by their venture into the foreign food scene, and ideas were born. One that comes to mind is Soranoiro, who brought back the idea of putting a vegan ramen on his menu.  This is where Ippudo comes in.    As an homage to their trip to France, Ippudo created a French-Japanese fusion bowl. The dashi is a blend of French beef consomme and traditional Japanese broth. The noodles are half Japanese flour and half French bread flour. The toppings are roast beef, red onion, and sauteed mushrooms.  Sounds good on paper, and it sure looks tasty.    Camera rolling, this was the first YouTube video I've made without testing it beforehand.  Luckily, it was excellent. I think the key were the noodles. By using some French bread flour, you almost get a sense of dipping a crusty baguette into a lovely consomme. Really interesting. I don't know how a stand-alone shop of this nature would fare, but in the Shin-Yokohama Raumen Museum, it is a perfect fit.    Two other menu items are worth a note. First is the vegetarian ramen. This one works, using extra mushrooms to make up for the lack of beefy umami present in the regular bowl. As always, I enjoyed the meat version more, but this was a pleasant surprise. Not too sweet, which is a problem with vegetarian soups I've found.    There is also a French-inspired ochazuke. Rice, topped with roast beef, and drowned in consomme. Good, but you'll probably want to save room for another couple shops. This is the Raumen Museum after all!    Like every other shop at the museum, you can order mini bowls. You should plan your visit accordingly. I'd say start with a taste of something light, like Narumi Ippudo, then move to something a little heavier like Komurasaki or Nidai-me Genkotsu-ya, and finish with a thick one like Sumire or Ryu Shanghai. A full list of shops can be found here.    Check out the YouTube video!    If you enjoy this, or any of my YouTube videos, please subscribe and tell a friend. I'm spread a little thin with all the various ramen media projects I am in involved in, and would like to focus a bit more in 2015.

East Tokyo has always been in the shadow of the west in terms of ramen, so it is good to see a newcomer making a quality bowl.    The ingredients are strictly mukacho, preservative free.    This one almost felt more like a toripaitan, a creamy chicken soup ramen, than a tonkotsu, pork soup. The stinky traces of pork bones were non-existent, and the toppings, though uncommon for this kind of ramen, were fresh and tasty. Worthy of their praise.    Come in the evening and you can try some of their limited offerings. Miso-tonkotsu and a mazesoba were both on offer, and both were on point. Overall, I enjoyed the regular tonkotsu more, but the roasted tomato was a great touch.

Mega-rich soup with fresh toppings that put regular ramen to shame.    This one was recommended by the barbecue master at Hatos Bar, a nearby smokehouse barbecue spot that meat lovers need to know about. Don't tell anyone, but Sou-san, the master, prefers a good bowl of ramen over perfectly cooked ribs. Food is funny that way.    The menu is only a couple items; torishiroramen and bejitanmen. Both use the same soup, but differ in noodles and toppings.    The veggie version was hard to pass up. Chicken chashu, duck chashu, garlic toast, and a heap of colorful vegetables. 1500 yen is spendy, but not really that much for good food in the Naka-Meguro area.    If you are out here for the famous cherry blossoms that line the river during March and April, Usagi Shokudo is a good bet for a quick bite.  Followed, of course, by some barbecue and craft beer at Hatos Bar!      東京都目黒区青葉台1-30-12 Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Aobadai 1-30-12 Closest station: Naka-Meguro  Open 11:30-22:00 Closed Mondays  ",

Since the original shop in Ebisu paved the way for more oshare - stylish - ramen shops, AFURI has opened half a dozen more shops in the Tokyo area.  Do they still hold up?    Unfortunately, I feel that they have lost a lot in the expansion. This shop in Nakameguro, though stylish, lacked deep flavors and had no tasty impact. They were lauded as having the best light tasting ramen in town, but now it is just too light.    I should note that I tried their winter limited bowl, a miso with smoked meats and ginko nuts.    My friend, the writer of a new ramen blog on the scene, had their normal bowl. Lackluster.

The taste is heavy on the sweet and low on the porky goodness level that, say, somewhere like Ippudo has. But as far as chains go, you can't beat them for convenience. Wow, I feel sick saying that.  But the original shop in Fukuoka was unique bowls, so I wanted to try it. Yes, that is pretty much the only reason.  To the honten (main shop)!    But . . . they don't have the famous rectangular bowls. Yes, I'm being petty here. But this will probably be my last time slurping Ichiran, so I need to make it count. Turns out the first floor of the honten doesn't even serve ramen! Have some original Ichiran dumplings, instead.    After some conversation with a very young staff member, we found that it was actually the Nishidori shop that does the special bowls. A five minute walk away.    That's more like it!    Of course, one of the perks of Ichiran is the customization. I always say that this is so when you get your lackluster bowl, the blame is on you, the customer, for choosing the wrong combination. In the past, I had gone for normal levels. I've since learned. Once again, though, not the greatest bowl in Japan.  From top to bottom - amount of tare seasoning, thickness of the soup, amount of garlic, type of negi onion, pork yes or no, amount of spice, and firmness of the noodles. They probably have an English version.    As always, sit down in your private cubicle.    And await your bowl.    My mistake this time was choosing こい味, a strong amount of tare seasoning liquid. The tare here is the biggest problem. So sweet! The choice of double spice neutralized this a bit.    Still crushed it though.

        "post": " ラーメン総選挙    Global ramen force Ippudo recently held their third annual ramen competition. That's founder Kawahara-san (河原) above. Out of 176 entries, only 14 were invited to present their bowl to a jury of ramen professionals. I was honored to be invited as a judge, and though I approach ramen in general as fun food, I took this seriously. The winner would get 3,000,000 yen, about $30,000. Amazing.    The theme this year was dashi. I think this follows the current trend of thinking in Tokyo's ramen scene; focus on something simple, while doing everything you can to extract as much umami flavors from your ingredients as possible. All of the ramen was fantastic. Here are some of the bowls.    オレンジ香る鯛塩ラーメン～地中海の風～  Chef Suzuki-san (鈴木) crafted a tai and salt ramen with an aroma of orange peel. There were a lot of Italian influences, and the addition of an olive and sun-dried tomato paste added a lot of depth.    うま味海苔出汁そば  Chef Kimura (木村) went super simple, and the roasted nori senbe on top was fragrant and beautiful. Under the nori was a kinchaku, a tofu bag filled with minced chicken and mushroom that exploded in flavor when ripped open. The soup went from simple and fragrant to intense and flavorful. Very cool.    鯨丸  Chef Nakamura-san (中村) from Nagasaki used whale as his main ingredient. Whale can be a bit gamey, not something you would expect to be used as an ingredient in a light soup. But the chef's skill with a controversial ingredient from his hometown really came out in the end product.    HIPPIE RAMEN ～Hollywood Legend～  Chef Isobe-san from Los Angeles based Tatsu Ramen made a vegan ramen. Wow, this was actually one of the best vegetarian ramen bowls I have ever tasted. I think if America can contribute one thing to the world of ramen in general, it is excellent vegetarian versions of a typically meaty dish.    ALWAYS  Chef Sasahara-san (篠原) focused on things that have been and will always be good. Simple and delicious. I dug the softly scrambled egg, which melted into the soup and gave it a rich, eggy flavor.    NORIDASU RAMEN (EMBARK)  Chef Conner Callahan is the kitchen supervisor at Ippudo in New York. Donning his colorful uniform, he came with a complex bowl that told the story of his connections with ramen and the sea. Three kinds of dashi, a dashi foam, and plenty of Italian influence from his childhood growing up in an Italian fishing village.    GREEN TEA NOODLES  Chef Futa-san (太田) works at a tea shop, and made this playful macha ramen. She wanted slurpers to exclaim \"Kawaii!\" when they were served, and it sure worked. The taste wasn't sweet at all, instead tasted of a chicken soup base.    The winner? Chef Kimura-san took home the prize. Congratulations, your bowl really shone. You will be able to try his ramen in Ippudo stores across the country soon. Here it is one more time.     Check the video we made!    ",

This is another one of Hiroshima's soupless tantanmen shops. The recent boom of this style remains a mystery. Clever marketing or something more?    ZIP! Hey, I did that show before, I think. Maybe not.    Pretty decent one here. As always, a small serving of noodles sitting in a spicy oil sauce. Moderate amounts of sansho pepper gave this one a little kick, and it went really well with a beer.    Mix it up. Part of the Hiroshima shirunashi tantanmen scene is to put a bowl of rice into the leftover sauce. That might explain why the serving sizes were all quite small. Probably a tasty idea, but I was in foodie mode, what with the handy map I picked up.    Having crushed three of them, plus the King-Ken popup in Ginza, I feel like I did Hiroshima's soupless scene a little justice. See you next year!      広島県広島市中区八丁堀8-10 Hiroshima-ken, Hiroshima-shi, Naka-ku, Hatchobori 8-10 Closest station: Tatemachi on the Street Car  Open 11:00-15:00, 17:00-20:00 Closed Sundays  ",

It barely fits on the official Hiroshima shirunashi tantanmen map.  The menu, like that of any specialty shop, is small. Hot or cold. That's pretty much it. You can get different sizes, and I was the only person who didn't go with the double size bowl.    As always, mix it up. Dry noodles, a little spicy sauce, and some sparse toppings.    To be honest, I wasn't feeling this one. It was cheap and tasty, but I don't think I can recommend anyone who doesn't live in Hiroshima spend the time to make it out here. Most travelers have limited time in this town, and should stick more to the downtown.      広島県広島市中区舟入川口町5-13 Hiroshima-ken, Hiroshima-shi, Chu-ku, Funairikawaguchicho 5-13 Closest station: Funairisaiwaicho on the Street Car  Open 11:00-14:00, 18:00-20:00 Sundays 11:00-15:00 Closed Wednesdays  ",

In recent years, Hiroshima has seen a boom in 汁なし担担麺. Spicy soupless noodles. Why Hiroshima? I have no idea! They already have their own genre of noodles; spicy Hiroshima tsukemen. Do they really need another?  I don't care. This is one of my favorite styles of noodles. I've gone so far as to spend half a day searching it out in Beijing. By the way, the best of the best in Tokyo is at Lashohan. But I'm getting distracted. With 19 shops on the official shirunashitantanmen map, I had some work cut out for me.  Turns out Sunday is a poor day to go, as half the shops are closed. Randomly, I chose the closest one to the hotel. Musashibo's menu is simple, and the noodles came out quick.    If you are a fan of this style, you just know. This one is good. It is so simple; noodles, ground pork, green onions, and spices.    And then you see it. Right there on the counter.    Three kinds of sansho! This is a good thing. This is a very good thing. It's that spice, often called Chinese numbing pepper, or Sichuan peppercorn, that makes any kind of tantanmen great. Sansho gives a bitter, tongue-numbing kick to anything it touches. Either you love it or hate it. I absolutely love the stuff.  若山椒 - wakasansho - young sansho is strong on the bitter flavors. 赤山椒 - akasansho - red sansho that has a bit of heat to it. 青山椒 - aosansho - green sansho with a strong fragrance and heavy numbing powers.    There are rules to this style. Ten of them in fact.    1. Add sansho to your liking. 2. Mix it up. 3. Really mix it up. 4. You'd better keep mixing it. 5. Eat it before it gets cold! 6. Throw in some rice with whatever is left in the bowl. 7. Kick it up with any of the counter-top seasonings. 8. Mix, mix, mix. 9. Even if it gets a bit cold, it's still good. 10. Thank you.    This one was fantastic.    Very close to the Peace Park, a must-visit spot in Hiroshima.  And for anyone who says, \"You're crazy! You go all the way to Hiroshima and just eat tantanmen! You're missing out on some famous okonokiyaki!\"    I ain't missing anything!

        "post": " ちゃんぽん亭総本家 彦根駅前本店    Holy smokes! I discovered a minor Japanese ramen style that I had no idea existed!  I make it no secret that I am a big ramen nerd, and thusly try and know as much as I can about not just the Tokyo ramen scene, but the fascinating world of local ramen throughout Japan. So when I rolled into Hikone Station, on the banks of Lake Biwa, and saw a famous-in-our-town poster at the station, I was shocked to see something new.    Omi champon. I had heard of omigyu, the locally raised cattle with well marbled meat, but had never heard of a locally branded ramen. I had also heard of champon, the famous ramen style from Nagasaki. Gotta grab a bowl.    According to the champon wikipedia page, 近江ちゃんぽん dates back to the 90s, when local shop Champontei wanted to expand their brand and become a franchise chain. By creating a local style, they could count on a minor influx of tourism, and things like the previously mentioned train station poster calling them out by name.  Yeah, this one isn't looking to good.    But then I dug into it. Omi champon is defined as having a light broth made with konbu seaweed and katsuo fish. Top with a hug pile of crisp vegetables, and give the customer lots of vinegar on the table to hit it with. This bowl was, shockingly, quite good. Although I think the concept of making this a local dish is corny, in the end I recommend it to anyone who is in this area and needs an affordable bowl.  Not worth a huge detour, but Hikone is a quaint little castle town that might be worth a trek for someone living in the Kansai area.    Of course, B-list celebrities put on their best faces for the cameras, as always.

While English-speakers are few and far between (check out the blogroll on the right to see some), there are plenty of Japanese ramen hunters in Japan. Kabo-chan took it to the next level, and took over a tiny shop that was planning on shutting down. That was a few years ago.    When Kabo-chan made a special limited bowl of miso one winter, fans were delighted. So much so that the one-month special became a permanent menu item.    Flavorful red miso.    Sansho. I am a huge fan of Chinese numbing pepper.    The noodles are under-cooked, then given a a minute more in the boiling soup.    The whole thing is heavily spiced. Almost a curry miso with undertones of Chinese sansho pepper. Very nice.    Seems like Kabo-chan kept another limited item on the menu as well. You can, even in the dead of winter, get a bowl of Japanese-style shaved ice. For me, the miso will do just fine.        東京都北区西ヶ原1-54-1 Tokyo, Kita-ku, Nishigahara 1-54-1 Closest station: Komagome  Open 11:30-15:00, 17:30-21:00 Closed Wednesdays  ",

The second was Harada, another Tatsuura tantanmen shop, only about five minutes from Ezawa. When we arrived, they had just run out of noodles. This was just after 1:30pm. Keep that in mind for any future rides.    The next shop on our list, Daichan, was also closed! Are you kidding! Actually, the TV crew loved it, and the theme of this shoot, along with another one we did in Tokyo, was of me being a bumbling foodie who shows up at shop after shop, only to be greeted with a closed sign.  Good for TV, kind of bad for the ego.    Had a nice ride at least.    Well, the crew wanted more footage, so we searched for the closest shop within the city limits. This was Kimitsu City, a city not known for much. Ramen Teio was ranked number four in town. Not sure if that is a good or bad sign, as the local shops were few in number to start with. That ranking may be number four out of five.    And . . . action!    I always feel bad dissing a ramen shop on TV. But usually a shop with such a large menu is asking for it.    I went with the Katsuura tantanmen inspired bowl. You know, to compare to the bowl I had earlier.    Actually, it was quite nice.    This is a simple style, and then addtion of some excellent chashu made it a welcome meal. Very much a local's place, with comics for the kids and TVs for the adults. I could see a nearby family coming here once a week and having a simple evening out.      千葉県君津市北子安6-17-8 Chiba-ken, Kimitsu-shi, Kitakoyasu 6-17-8 Closest station: Kimitsu  Open 11:00-14:30, 17:00-22:00 Closed Wednesdays  ",

        "post": " 江ざわ    Ramen Riders! Let's do this!    First a bit of an introduction. We rode our bikes to Katsuura, a small city in the southeast of Chiba Prefecture. Not a lot out here; just some nice beaches, a lot of farms, and an original style of ramen.  Katsuura tantanmen is in a class of its own. Not tantanmen in any sense of the Chinese relative, dandanmien. Not at all. Katsuuta tantanmen is characterized by a shoyu soup hit with a large amount of rayu spicy oil, and topped with plenty of raw diced onions. The existence of a local tantanmen map is proof that this town is serious about their local style.    Ezawa is the ganso, or founder of Katsuura tantanmen. I'd actually gone to the original shop not once, but twice, and been rejected each time (they were closed). Since then, they have moved into this shiny new building. And though the walls are clean and modern, the soup is the same as its been since the 60s.    Just two of us this time, as this was very short notice for a ride. We were followed by a TV crew who was shooting for some late-night show that will air in Osaka in the near future.    \"Whether coming or going, you'll be thinking of Ezawa.\" Or something along those lines.    The menu is simple. Tantanmen for 800 yen seemed like the best bet.    I was initially mixed on this one. I didn't really understand how un-tantan this tantanmen was until first sip. That was definitely a negative for me, as the fiery burn of spicy Chinese noodles is one of my favorite things. I also don't like raw onions so much. Another negative.  But then, after a minute or two passed, and the onions softened a bit, this ramen took on a deep flavor. It felt very countryside, like something they'd make in a giant pot and feed a farming family of 15. Good stuff, full of energy. The spice was a slow burn. The regular level (you can opt for medium or strong spice) seemed to be just right for someone who enjoys spiciness.    The layer of spicy oil meant I wouldn't be finishing every drop, until I read a sign on the wall. Basically, \"When you finish the bowl, you'll have a surprise!\"    I can't pass up a challenge!    What was the secret at the bottom?    まいど. Maido is Kansai dialect for thank you. That was a brutal journey just for that.  Regardless, maido to Ezawa for sure. Though I'm still confused about the tantanmen moniker, as far as ramen goes, this one was a success.      千葉県勝浦市白井久保字原296-8 Chiba, Ken, Katsuura-shi, Shiraikubo 296-8 Closest station: Katsuura  Open 11:30-19:00 Closed Mondays  ",

        "post": " bird    I'll admit, I'm a sucker for gimmicky ramen. And a bowl topped with cotton candy is about as gimmicky as it gets!    This tiny shop is just off one of the many covered shotengai shopping streets that criss-cross Osaka. I guess this area is considered Nakazaki, or maybe it is still part of Umeda. Either way, wandering around this part of central Osaka felt foreign and confusing to me. I love it, being lost in a new town.    Unfortunately, the craft beer bar next door was completely full, or else I would have waited there for Mr. Philoramen, another ramen blogger whom I met recently. I opted, instead, to wander around what seemed to be the center of Kansai's love hotel district. This part of town is loud, dirty, and colorful. Perfect for drinks and ramen.    bird has only ramen and tsukemen on the menu, with either normal or thick. The master recommended the thicker one.    Ok, here's the deal. That cloud of spun sugar almost immediately dissolves into the soup. Sugar in ramen sounds bad, but quite often the tare seasoning contains a lot of sweet mirin and sugar, and some of the best chashu is very, very sweet.    The spun sugar, as long as it is mixed properly into the soup, wasn't a problem at all. In fact, I really dug this 100% chicken soup. It was thick and creamy, with noodles that matched very well. The chashu, a thick-cut piece, had obviously been stewing in some delicious sauce for a while.    The problem, and it was a big one, arose when I tried my friend's soup. He hadn't mixed the sugar into the soup completely, and I got a massively sweet hit of light soup and sugar. So much sugar, in fact, that my taste buds were a bit wrecked. As I left the shop, I had a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). Make sure you don't make my mistake, unless you have a serious sweet tooth.      大阪府大阪市北区堂山町8-10 Osaka-shi, Kita-ku, Doyamacho 8-10 Closest station: Umeda  Open 17:00-5:00am  ",

        "post": " 麺屋7.5Hz+ 梅田店    7.5Hz+ is a shop with a few branches in Northern Osaka, all serving an excellent takaida style ramen. Before I continue, I should mention that, while writing this, I am listening to a binaural 7.5htz theta wave meditation audio track. This sort of sound is meant to induce deep levels of relaxation in the subconscious mind.    Takaida ramen (高井田ラーメン) is an Osaka style with a few key characteristics. The noodles are thick and straight. The dashi is made from chicken and konbu kelp. The liberal addition of heavy soy sauce is a must. It sounds very simple, but digging into a bowl of this stuff is a very unique experience.  I should also note that takaida style is meant to be a bit rustic, and emerged as a post-war comfort food in the hustle and bustle of Osaka.    Very comforting indeed. I think the use of this type of noodle, almost like udon, fits amazingly well.    After listening to that audio track for the last 15 minutes, I can actually say that I feel relaxed and content. Though those feelings might stem from reliving my memories of this bowl, spent slurping with my friend Ben, followed by a two hour nap on the bullet train back to Tokyo.

Akane is the translator who has been working diligently for the past couple of years at the Osaka Ramen School. To make the trip even more relevant, one of the school's former students has a shop in town. With some cheap rented bicycles, we set out to try it.    Handmade noodles and gyoza. I didn't try the dumplings, but a bowl of the shop's tamon tsukemen was a must. A little more expensive than the standard tsukemen, the tamon version has noodles made with whole wheat flour. As the school teaches a lot about noodle making, this special version was looking great.    Straight from Hokkaido to his noodle machine.    Wow, those were some great noodles. Very hearty, and I regret not getting a larger size.  The chashu was decadent, the egg perfect, and the menma crisp. All of this went into a very, very thick soup.    And the fact that this came out of the Osaka Ramen School made it even better!

Miso from the big city? Preposterous!    Making it just minutes before their lunch shift ended, a proper kanpai was in order. I was having a bowl with one of my best friends, Keizo Shimamoto. You know, the guy who went to New York and crushed the entire casual foodie culture with his ramen burger.    This shop is connected to Shichisai and Kujira Shokudo, both known for being MSG free and having excellent homemade noodles.    Two ramen nerds trying something new. We live for this sort of thing.    Very unique. The miso was a red miso, a bit sweet, without much impact. The relatively light taste of the soup meant that any other strong flavors would take center-stage. The stronger flavor? Those little drops of oil were gobo, burdock root. Along with some crispy fried gobo on top, this was kind of a gobo overload, with the fried taste leaving a strong aftertaste on the tongue. No necessarily bad, but kind of a strange, earthy taste that lingered for about 20 minutes.    I know that, at least in America, urban ingredients are kind of hot. A possible new trend?    Mine was the tokusei, special ramen, on the top row at 980 yen.        東京都武蔵野市境2-3-20 Tokyo, Musashino-shi, Sakai 2-3-20 Closest station: Musashi-Sakai  Open 11:30-14:30, 18:00-21:00 Saturdays 11:30-17:00 Closed Sundays  ",

Middle of nowhere, highly ranked, only open for a few hours a day, and often closed well before the posted closing time. Well, the posted closing time of 2:30pm is just a suggestion, as the official time is simple when the soup and pork run out. And on that fateful day, the soup had run out.    So when my English education company sent me to do a children's camp just 20 minutes away, I made sure to return.    The wait was longer than my drive, though a proper drive from central Tokyo would take about an hour and a half to get here. I immediately ordered the chashumen, hoping to dine on copious amounts of fatty roasted pork. In broken English I was told that the pork was almost sold out, and I would have to settle for the regular bowl.    That and an order of the shop's famous gyoza. The gyoza dumplings look to be a huge draw, and you can take massive orders to go. 50 pieces for 2000 yen? That seems ridiculously cheap.    The ramen was exactly what was expected. A heavy, intense pork broth topped with a few pieces of mega-tender chashu that made me wish I had arrived earlier. By the way, the pork was almost out at noon, and the shop had only opened at 11.  A tad on the sweet side of the spectrum, but balanced by the use of extra ground pepper on top.

Hototogisu is now a seven day a week operation, with yet another limited one-day bowl on Fridays.    Hototogisu Ha (覇 means champion) does a beef and miso ramen. In typical kodawari fashion, everything about this one is premium. Two different beef stocks are paired with two different Japanese dashi, making this officially a quadruple soup ramen. The beef is highly ranked (between A3 and A5 grade) wagyu.    Solid. Personally, I prefer the other two Hototogisu offerings over this one, as anything beef tends to be on the sweet side for me.

I keep a rough note of places that are recommended by other ramen nerds, or maybe I saw it on TV, or it was in a magazine and looked tasty. All I had written was Kichijoji, celery, and tomato. Not very descriptive.    The shop is extremely generic and clean. Counter seating for eight and tables for 12. As I was told to do by the menu, I went with the mozzarella tomato ramen.    It was quite forgettable. Who is this shop for? The ramen wasn't good enough for it to be a popular ramen destination. And the shop was a bit too formulaic to fit in as one of Kichijoji's quaint little bistros.  With a little digging, I found that this shop is connected to the Matsuya group; a chain of beef bowl shops that are everywhere in Japan. With no rhyme or reason, they are also in the tomato ramen business now.  Skip this one and head to the local Ippudo.

This one was for a TV shoot, and they insisted on visiting somewhere I hadn't been. This is a risky move, as I refuse to lie on TV if bad ramen is put in front of me. Luckily, Sugimoto was recommended by one of Tokyo's top ramen chefs, Miyazaki-san over at Soranoiro, and his stamp of approval is powerful.    Special shio ramen. This one promised to be topped with extra chashu pork, an egg, and some of the shops homemade wontons.    Yep, a simple, yet perfect bowl. This is the trend these days. Overly simple clear broth, meticulously created to be at a maximum level. The master trained at Shinasobaya, the shop made famous by late ramen master Sano-san.    Love those eggs! Good eggs are kind of normal these days, but these seemed better than average. Turns out they are hard-to-procure Nagoya Cochin chicken, considered some of the best in Japan. The cost of these eggs are very high, and the master told me that he pretty much breaks even with these.    Of course, the shop has a shoyu ramen as well, and tsukemen, which is all good I assume.    Even though the Seibu-Shinjuku train line sees very few sightseers, the ramen on this line is amazing. Shichisai, Hanamichi, Muteppo, and now Sugimoto sit very high up on my list of favorite shops.      東京都中野区鷺ノ宮4-2-3 Tokyo, Nakano-ku, Saginomiya 4-2-3 Closest station: Saginomiya  Open 11:30-15:00, 18:00-21:00 Monday 11:30-15:00 Closed Tuesdays  ",

        "post": " Ivan Ramen: Love, Obsession, and Recipes    Good advice for most ramen shop chefs, and equally good advice for authors, is to avoid reading reviews on the internet. That said, the minute I picked up Ivan's new cookbook and memoir, I went straight to the 1-star reviews. Of course, when you see that there are only a handful, you realize that they are moot. Yes, this isn't a typical cookbook. Typical in the sense of hundreds and hundreds of recipes. But as far as ramen (in ramen shops) goes, any ramen shop with a massive menu covering the entire spread of the ramen world is gonna be a bad time.  Ivan Ramen, the book, is essentially an intense breakdown of what goes into a bowl of ramen. It is no surprise that the word obsession is in the title.    The book is half memoir, half recipes, and half about ramen culture in Japan. With a disheartening introduction by David Chang about how people don't get ramen.    The recipe is perfect. Ivan breaks down the components of ramen step by step. Ramen isn't a soup dish, where everything goes into a pot. Ramen is layers and layers. Focus on each individually, and tweak as needed. I love this approach, though it might be a little daunting for the casual home cook.        Of course, he gives recipes for some of his other dishes, as well as all the toppings. I think most home cooks will try to make the four cheese mazemen. I miss the four cheese mazemen, as Ivan Plus is now closed.    Hey, I'm in the book! Yep, that is me in the black t-shirt at the opening of Ivan Plus. I never signed a release! I want my royalties!    Along with an awesome shot of my bad posture are some excellent interviews with Osaki-san, the most famous ramen critic in Japan, and Shimazaki-san, the Rock and Roll ramen chef. These give a cool little insight into ramen culture in Japan. Most overseas food fans outside of Japan don't realize how big these names are.    I'm not an avid cookbook collector, but this one seems like a must-have for anyone who would ever consider making ramen at home. Hey, you could even outright steal the recipe and open your own shop, if you were so inclined.  Ivan Ramen: Love, Obsession, and Recipes from Tokyo's Most Unlikely Noodle Joint   The book is only about $20 these days.  One of these days I'll start cooking at home. And when I do, I'll give this recipe a try. I'm curious to hear if any of my readers have tried the dishes in this book. Let me know!  ",

        "post": " Ramen Burger    The original ramen burger has arrived in Japan, by way of New York and the world.    Taking residence on the second floor of Saikoro was a bold move. It is tough to pass up the solid bowl on the first floor!    A quick history of the Ramen Burger is in order. If you've been a long-time reader of Ramen Adventures, you know that Keizo Shimamoto quit his job in Los Angeles, moved to Japan, and worked in a number of Japanese ramen shops. Eventually, he had an opportunity to go to New York to help open a branch of one of those shops; Basanova. Well, things didn't work out, and instead of heading back to Japan, Keizo hooked up with some of his many connections to get a booth at Smorgasburg. Smorgasburg is some sort of weekend food festival in Brooklyn. What could he serve (ramen is notoriously tough to make at outdoor festivals)? Did anyone see this Vice video?    As there was already a bit of buzz about a ramen burger (hipsters love Vice!), the initial push was strong. Add that to the fact that the media was growing tired of the cronut (croissant /  doughnut) and looking for a new food trend to report on.  This perfect storm of hype and media drew huge crowds, the positive reviews from people who braved the lines began pouring in, and it just went from there. The Ramen Burger has popped up here and there in the States, at festivals and events, but it was never seen in Japan (apart from that initial time he made it for Vice).  That was back in 2013. About two years later, it finally hits Japan.    First, it's salad time!    The salad was great! Thinking back, I can't recall a time in my nine years in Japan that I've seen a chopped salad. A nice appetizer before the main course.    Some sort of high-tech wrapper (the staff will explain) means that you can take these to go.    And there it is. The Ramen Burger. I feel like everyone already knows this, but the bun is made from ramen noodles. Some arugula and secret shoyu sauce go on a 100% American Angus beef patty.    The works come with cheese, bacon, and egg.  My opinion on the Ramen Burger?  It lives up to the hype. It's fun and innovative and full of flavor.    The burger scene in Tokyo isn't near what it is in many American cities, but don't get it wrong, there is a scene. Martini Burger, 3rd Burger, and Burger Mania all make Ramen Adventure approved burgers. There's even a $150 Kobe burger at the Ritz-Carlton.  And now the Ramen Burger. Check it out!    Let me know what you think in the comments or over at the Ramen Adventure Facebook page. The Ramen Burger is a crazy phenomenon, and thus the opinions are all over the place. Is it ramen? Is it a burger? Let me know!    東京都中野区中野2-28-8 2F Tokyo, Nakano-ku, Nakano 2-28-8 2F Closest station: Nakano  Open 11:00-21:00  ",

Though the shop is in Shinjuku, Miyake-san hails from a small industrial city in Shikoku. And I just so happened to be headed to Niihama.  I asked the master if there were any shops he recommended. He listed a couple, and Jun really stood out to me.    Jun specializes in a typical double soup tsukemen. A heavy pork soup blended with another heavy fish soup. This style is a dime a dozen these days, but even the average shop tends to be quite tasty.    Jun is certainly above average. The smoky fishiness from the katsuo stands out. Shikoku is very well known for their production of excellent katsuo, though that all happens on the opposite side of the island. Also of note in the bowl was the excellent seasoned menma. Great stuff.    For an extra 50 yen, get a spoonful of the shop's homemade rayu. It's not overly spicy in the least, and adds a solid punch to the already solid bowl.    I don't expect many of my readers to make it down here. Matsuyama to the west and Takamatsu to the east offer much more in terms of things to do. Niihama does, though, have some nice roads into the mountains that are worth it if you are on a motorcycle.        愛媛県新居浜市久保田町2-1-43 Ehime-ken, Niihama-shi, Kubotacho 2-1-43 Closest station: Niihama  Open 11:00-15:00, 17:00-21:00 Weekends 11:00-21:00 Closed Mondays  ",

Immediately after, I did some research, postponed my morning ferry ride, and set out to Arida, a city just 30km south of Wakayama proper. Can Seino redeem the entire genre of Wakayama ramen?    Highly ranked is always a good sign. Only open for lunch is also a good sign.    People started arriving about an hour before they opened. Another good sign.    There are a lot of choices. You have shoyu, chicken shio, thick Wakayama, and Arida black. They all looked great, and their claim to fame is the shoyu. But I wanted to try the Wakayama. Dreaming of rich brown soup was how I spent the night before.    A note on shoyu; Wakayama is quite famous for their soy sauce history. Many claim that nearby Yuasa (only a few kilometers from this shop) is the birthplace of the stuff, and you can still find craft brewers making small batches of high quality shoyu. A few of the best shops in Tokyo use Wakayama shoyu, a testament to its quality.  But this isn't Tokyo, this is Wakayam. How does this one look?    Yes! This is what ramen adventuring is all about. A ridiculously rich bowl, with just enough bite on the homemade noodles. The soy sauce really comes through with a huge initial impact, followed by a smooth, porky aftertaste. Tender chashu, an egg that burst with flavor, and seasoned menma complete the dish.    A side of shirasu gohan is recommended.    The line wasn't unbearable, but make sure you get there well before they close to avoid disappointment.      和歌山県有田市野696 Wakayama-ken, Arida-shi, No 696 Closest station: Minoshima  Open 11:00-14:00 Closed Tuesdays and some Mondays  ",

Wakayama has their own style of ramen, and it is one of the most under-appreciated styles in Japan. Thick, porky tonkotsu soup with a deep shoyu base that gives it a rich brown color. I was excited!    The highly ranked shop near the station was closed, so I randomly chose this one while wandering the streets.    Let this be a lesson. Plan your ramen adventures out in advance, lest you end up slurping a flavorless bowl of salty water.    The shocking part is that Wakayama-style is one of the strongest in the country.  The highly ranked one, by the way, is Ideshoten.

Let's break it down.    最強 - Saikyo pretty much means amazing.  アメリカ・ラーメン男 - American ramen dude.  東京 - Tokyo.  極ウマ - Goku Uma. Super tasty. Uma (馬) can mean horse, but the uma here means delicious.   50店 - 50 shops.  食べる - Eat.    More or less a guide to 50 great ramen shops in Tokyo.    You like that cover?        I was able to convince them to include some English as part of the book. Though aimed at the Japanese audience, I hope a lot of English speakers will use it when they visit Tokyo.      The Japanese ramen review pages have more details.       I even included a few essay stories, like this one about my trip up to Kitakata to crush bowls with some friends.                                  These aren't translated into English, sorry.  So there you have it. If you wanted a guide to 50 great shops in Tokyo, now you have it.  You can click here to get it from Amazon Japan.  Bad news, though, it's only available in Japan! Distribution is in major bookstores and the Japanese Amazon site, but not overseas. If you live overseas and want a copy, you can take advantage of the weak yen and I'll send you one for $25, worldwide express shipping included.

When the motorcycle navigation system tells you there is ramen nearby, you go! Luckily, I was with a few other ramen riders. This was the start of Golden Week, a national holiday week in the beginning of May.    Hamamatsu is a city about 200km from Tokyo on the east side of Aichi Prefecture. Any foodie can tell you, this town is famous for unagi. And yes, eel makes its way into this bowl of ramen. So does local shirasu whitebait fish, local nori seaweed, and local mikan orange.    We were mixed on this bowl. Personally, I loved it. Eel bones are often fried and then eaten as a snack, and that fried eel bone flavor really came through in this soup. Slightly smoky, slightly buttery.    If you aren't into fishy flavors, stay away from this one.    All around a solid bowl, and they are open late if you are in Hamamatsu for business.      静岡県浜松市中区鍛冶町319-21 Aichi-ken, Hamamatsu-shi, Chuo-ku, Kajimachi 319-21 Closest station: Hamamatsu  Open 17:00-2:30am Fridays and Saturdays 17:00-4:30am Closed Sundays  ",

We fly in to who-knows-where, do our job, and hop over to the next big city. So when you work in a place like Tokushima, it can be quite motainai, unfortunate. No time to hunt out famous ramen. Only time to wait for that damn bus.    Well, I was determined. Don't tell anyone, but I still, after all these years, don't own a smartphone. A quick search on a ramen app would have shown half a dozen highly ranked shops in the area. Tokushima is, after all, one of Japan's famous ramen towns. You can refer to some past posts to see what I'm talking about. Inotani, 3no3, and Sanpa.    Instead, I just wandered. Time was of the essence, so the closest thing would have to suffice. The closest thing was on a little shotengai, shopping street, next to the station. Tons of charm, no customers. Is that a good or a bad sign?    Well, the ramen wasn't that great. I'll leave it at that.    But the staff were a collection of characters. She's been cooking here for 44 years. \"Go look in the other room,\" she told me. \"You'll see me!\"    Sure enough, there was a collection of what I can only describe as fat old lady dolls.

This one is inside the Tokyo Ramen Street, a collection of eight shops within Tokyo's newly remodeled Tokyo Station.  I don't think I even need to talk about this one, the above picture of their Special Edo-Style Chukasoba is enough.    As is this one of their vegan ramen.    The menu here is reflective of their main shop, with just enough switched up to make it a different beast. The chukasoba has thinner noodles, thin strips of menma, and a delectable chunk of kakuni stewed pork. The price is a bit high at 1100 yen, but you really get a lot of value for that 特製. Tokusei means special.    Nice work Miyazaki-san.    Soon they will have an Okinawan style shio ramen and a vegan tantanmen.  This shop space used to be for Shichisai. And while I am sad to see them go, Soranoiro is a worthy successor.    Nice design. Tokyo Station is a crazy place, with millions of people using it daily. It's nice to be able to relax for a few minutes and enjoy a slurp.    Yes, I am biased. Anyone with a Soranoiro sticker on their phone must be a fan. Just above Den.    Tokyo Ramen Street is always changing. Some of the shops, like Rokurinsha, will never leave.

While I haven't been to the original restaurant, they are quite famous and based on their reputation should be able to pull off a tasty meal.    Can they do it? Can they make delicious eats at a ramen-only restaurant?    Nope! The tantanmen was flavorless, apart from a strange aftertaste. Just look at the above image. Does it look appetizing?    The spicy tantanmen isn't much better. The addition of sliced spring onion and hot chilies doesn't do much.    The shoyu ramen includes a sprinkling of mystery meat. Probably soy-based daizu.    Vegetarians, especially vegans, have a near impossible time in Tokyo. In a city that could be considered the culinary epicenter of the world, most chefs have no idea about the rules of dietary restrictions. Simple explaining that you can't eat meat, and you will probably get some fish and maybe a bit of chicken. Explain that fish is also taboo, and you may find a sprinkling of dried shrimp substituted for flavor. I speak from experience with that one.  I can't introduce you to good vegan cuisine at T's. The least I can do is link to some nice printable cards that may or may not help you out. Courtesy of Just Hungry.    http://justhungry.com/japan-dining-out-cards    Vegetarians are not completely in the dark when it comes to ramen. Please do yourself a favor and head over to Soranoiro for a bowl of their Vegan Ramen. It's an awesome bowl that meat eaters would be happy with. You can even get a green smoothie at Soranoiro while you wait for your noodles to cook. The vegan I was with was very happy with that combo.

This part of town can be dirty and confusing, and the presence to too many salarymen means the food can be rather generic.  Speaking of diamonds.    Diamonds!    Diamonds!    Diamonds!  The short walk to Chiranai Sakura will take you through what appears to be Japan's diamond district.    Just past all those overpriced rocks is the new Aki-Oka Gourmet Street, a collection of ramen shops built under the train tracks between Akihabara and Okachimachi stations.    The shops are mostly famous shops that have sold out and become boring chains (TETSU, Nantsutei, Nakamoto), except for one. Chiranai Sakura comes out of Nagano, and features some colorful art on the walls.    As well as an entire staff of females clad in colorful Japanese kimonos. 長野美人!    The menu, though not extensive, offers a few tasty-looking choices. The top-billed bowl is a standard chukasoba.    I was told by a ramen friend to get the 王様中華そば. Osama, fit for a king, brings together some local Nagano specialties to make a nice ご当地, local-style, bowl.    The local, in the case of this bowl, comes in the form of rustic negi green onions and a healthy kick of ginger. If you can imagine, historically, the life of someone living in Shinshu, the old name for Japan's Nagano area, you probably think of hardened farmers tilling the land day in and day out. Well, negi and shoga are both considered stamina foods, and there is enough stamina in this one to keep you running all day.    The negi are particularly good. Rough cut, they slowly melt into the soup as you slurp along. Any strong tastes dissolve into a sweetness that you only get from letting onions cook, naturally, into soup. Take that sweetness, along with the kick from the ginger, and you have local Shinshu ramen.    This shop is part of the awesome Bond of Hearts Group, which helps produce some great shops in Nagano and beyond.

        "post": " 銀座 朧月目黒処    Tonkotsu gyokai tsukemen isn't as dominating as it was a few years ago in the Tokyo ramen scene, but it is still the easiest thing to find. Any major station will have at least one highly ranked shop.    Oborozuki, meaning hazy moon, is Meguro's answer to thick, flavorful soup.    But I wasn't here for the thick stuff! No, I was on a hunt for good shio tsukemen. The popular Osaka-based ramen blogger at Philoramen turned me on to his favorite Tokyo shio tsukemen. I plan to hit them all, starting with his favorite.    Shio means a light soup. But how can you make a salt soup stronger without making it overly salty? Therein lies the problem I have with shio tsukemen. You can make a porky, fishy soup as thick as you want, and it will usually hit the mark. What can you add to a something non-viscous?    Seafood. This broth is full of octopus, scallops, and mussels. Along with an extra helping of negi onions and other greens, you get an intense seafood flavor without too much saltiness.  It isn't not salty, though. This soup is almost impossible to drink by itself. Better stick to the slurping.  Add in some pickled umeboshi, and squeeze on some lime.    The shio is yellow on the ticket machine. If you want what the shop recommends, their noko tsukemen, thick and normal, go for the tried-and-true upper left button.    東京都品川区上大崎3-3-4 Tokyo, Shinagawa-ku, Kamiosaki 3-3-4 Closest station: Meguro  Open 11:30-15:30, 17:30-23:00 Closed Sundays  ",

        "post": " 麺行使 伊駄天    Looking back at my (very) old postings on Ramen Adventures, I am both embarrassed by my writing and nostalgic about a time where I knew almost nothing about ramen. Idaten had a pop-up at the Tachikawa NY Ramen Square, and I went back in 2008. I went, I slurped, and I was surprised to learn that shoyu ramen can have a strong taste.    Fast forward half a decade . . .  They have been long gone from the Ramen Square, but the original shop in Shizuoka city is still popular.    Though the shoyu is still what most regulars order, I really wanted to see what the Teppen was. Billed as ご当地ラー麺, local ramen, I didn't know what to expect. Shizuoka is famous for a few things, but how can green tea and oranges make it into a bowl of ramen?    Oh, and Mt. Fuji. Very cute.    Idaten make their own noodles, so it was easy to incorporate a little matcha powder into the mix. Though the soup was light, you really don't get a massive tea flavor, just a slightly different texture.  And that chashu, well it was flavored with local mikan, a type of small Japanese orange. Interesting, for sure, though not something I will be getting again. Yes, this bowl is fun, but overshadowed by their regular menu.    Shizuoka city is a fantastic place for food. I'm not sure why, but this smallish town has more specialty gourmet, local sushi, and stylish cafes than any other comparable city in Japan.    Apart from the regular menu, Idaten has four limited bowls to reflect the seasons. I wish I was around here enough to sample them all.

I also tried to go to the Filipino show club next door, but was told that they don't accept gaijins.    Somehow ended up at a bar named after my drinking buddy's boyfriend, where another customer marked his favorite shop on my map. If I recall, he then guided us there, through the bustling streets of downtown Fukushima.    Rajanmen, a spicy, Chinese style dish.    It was spicy and hot and thick and sweet. Just what I needed at the time, though all that added sugar didn't help the next morning's hangover one bit.    Apparently, the waitress at this shop gave me some of her recommendations.

Rock'anDo makes their own in house, blending in ユーグレナ, also known as Euglenids, a kind of single-cell organism similar to algae. Considered by some to be a kind of superfood, this will make a bowl of ramen with a side of 抹茶割 (shochu mixed with green tea) seem like a healthy meal.    I was first clued in to Rock'anDo when they showed up at the recent Ramen Girls Festival. Their line was impressive, especially for a relative newcomer.  After slurping the real deal at their Ikebukuro shop, I can agree, this is some great shio ramen. Very light, with a lot of yuzu citrus flavoring the broth.    Fantastic, thick cut and roasted, the chashu is a welcome contrast to the clean lightness of the rest of the meal.    The top two rows are the green shio, followed by shoyu in red, and shio in yellow. Go green, it was great!    They let me sign their wall-of-fame.

        "post": " 饗 くろ㐂    I showed up to Motenashi Kuroki early in July. The special of the week was a simple shio tsukemen. Fantastic. But this is the start of the hottest season in Japan. Summer temperatures soar into the high 30s, even hitting the 40s on the worst of days. And while I despise the heat (and the humidity!), it means that hiyashichuka is back.  Hiyashi means cool, and limited release cold noodle dishes let chefs have a little fun, making things that they normally wouldn't keep on their menu.  I asked Kuroki-san if he would have a limited summer ramen. Of course! In fact, he was planning to have a new one every week.  Here are the first three. I'll try and make it to them all, though I can't guarantee anything. Do yourself a favor and head down to Akihabara Station and check out whatever he has going on. Get there early, as many, many ramen otaku will be lining up every day.    I'm a huge fan of tantanmen, so this one was right up my alley. It started with some fragrant negi oil. Nira and a creamy sesame sauce rounded out the liquid part. Add to that homemade komatsuna (a type of Japanese leafy vegetable) noodles and a chicken and tomato mince. Finally, top the whole thing with homemade rayu (spicy oil) and a red miso drizzle. Crazy!    Next was something I'm not the biggest fan of . . . natto. Fermented, slimy, stinky soy beans. But good natto isn't so bad, and this was some good natto. Paired with scallions and a colorful mix of lightly pickled vegetables, this one was very Japanese.  A very special niboshi tare oil rounded out the flavors.    Next came this one. Wheat noodles with a luxurious bonito jelly sauce. Toppings included corned beef, roast tomato, and an onion marinade.  What will he make next?!?  Check out my original Kuroki post here for more info.  And check out Kuroki-san's blog for daily updates to what he has. These limited hiyashi bowls are fun, but if you haven't had his shio ramen, you should go as soon as you can, it is top notch.  ",

        "post": " the RAMEN BOOK    The Ramen Book is another bilingual guide to ramen in Japan, albeit a much broader guide than my own book, 最強アメリカ・ラーメン男 東京 極ウマ50店を食べる. While mine is strictly a guide to 50 shops in Tokyo, The Ramen Book brings you in slowly; sort of a ramen 101.    It covers the basics, with great color photos and a few recommended shops to check out. Ishiyama is considered one of the most important ramen critics in Japan, so you can imagine that his hit-list is good.    By the way, almost every Tokyo shop in this book is also in mine!    There are explanations of local ramen in Japan, a primer on international chains, and some handy guides to help you navigate a ramen shop. If this review seems on the simple side, well, it is because this is a simple book! A perfect companion to sit on your bookshelf next to my book! It looks like you can order it on Amazon.com here.  My only gripe is that whoever was checking the English from the machine translations forgot to do the shoyu page! Rich aroma of soy sauce is re-charged decisive? The rest of the book is fine, just this one page. Whoops!  (by the way, my own book has a few mistakes as well, can you find them?)    With the upcoming Olympics, and a general global interest in Japanese ramen, I'm hoping our books will be of help to a lot of people.  ",

Tanaka bills itself as shinasoba; Chineses-style ramen. But, like most newer shops serving shinasoba, this a wholly Japanese take on noodles. And a very unique one at that.    Certainly well-regarded by the usual suspects, what makes this one so special?    To start with, the soup is a one-off creation. Inspired by the Chiba seaside, where shop master Tanaka-san spends a lot of time surfing, large amounts of dried sardine and horse mackerel are the first thing you notice. The next thing that hits you is the thickness. By using more konbu seaweed than normal, the soup becomes thick and packed with umami. It's very different, and very good.    The images are from Friday's limited menu, where he blends the normal stock with a heavier chicken broth. Both this and the regular bowl are stellar, but I prefer the normal, fish and konbu only bowl that you get on regular days. Friday's version is a bit extreme.    Tanaka-san commutes from the far side of Chiba every day; a trip that takes almost two hours. But we, the customer, could have it no other way. It's that surf, that closeness to the ocean, that comes through in his ramen.      東京都豊島区東池袋2-19-2 Tokyo, Toshima-ku, Higashi Ikebukuro 2-19-2 Closest station: Otsuka  Open 11:00-15:00, 17:00-22:00 Saturday 11:00-15:00 Closed Sundays  ",

Ishiyama-san with two of his latest books. He has over a dozen ramen books to his name. On the right is a fun manga giving info on the roots of 30 Tokyo shops. On the left is his new English guide to ramen. Direct competition with my book? You bet! Grab a copy here.    Back to the recommended ramen. Katsuoken promised copious amounts of, you guessed it, katsuo.    Bonito. Skipjack tuna. This is the fish that, when paired with konbu seaweed, gives that explosion of umami flavors we know and love. There is a rather new, and completely awesome ramen site out there called Ramen Chemistry that breaks down all that umami stuff. Give it a read if you want to know more.    Along with the soup already having quite a lot of the stuff, a strainer of dried katsuo flakes lets you treat your bowl like a fishy cup of tea.    I love that katsuo isn't fishy at all. More of a smoky, dried taste. American ramen shops have been known to substitute bacon for katsuo, but that is only because it is harder to get the good stuff in the States.  Toppings were good on the 870 yen special version, but I'd say stick with the regular. Yes, it is the button on the upper left of the ticket machine. Rule #5 at ramen shops, the upper left will get you something great.    Why not go for the biggest bowl?    Definitely to save room for a タタキ丼, a rice bowl covered with seared and seasoned katsuo.

To start, a spicy jerk chicken saute added a nice kick. Add to that banana chips, of all things, and you have a slightly sweet, slightly spicy flavoring to the shop's amazing noodles. Yes, the noodles here are fantastic.  I could see myself coming back to this shop to try their regular fare. Their most popular item, the tsukemen, looks to be similar to Fuunji's version, one of my favorite in Japan.

Others, like the heavy tonkotsu gyokai tsukemen craze, persist to this day.    The latest, and still relatively untested, is Nagoya-style Taiwan mazesoba. The original shop, Hanabi, is one of my favorite in the country. Take some thick noodles, cover them with spicy meat, some fish powder, a raw egg, and whatever else seems tasty, and serve.    Yamano is the highest ranked new Nagoya-style mazesoba in Tokyo. I know that is a narrow field, but you gotta take your wins where you can get them.    As always, mix it up with vigor.    I wasn't super into this one. My mistake, I think, was ordering the torobuta mazesoba (トロ豚ませそば). This one came with a massive chunk of stewed pork belly. It seems counter intuitive not to order delicious stewed pork, but this one was overly sweet, and clashed with the spicy, fatty flavors of the rest of the bowl. Stick with the basic mazesoba.    I'm a huge fan of junky, sloppy ramen, so I may have set the bar too high.        東京都練馬区豊玉北5-23-11 Tokyo, Nerima-ku, Toyotamakita 5-23-11 Closest station: Nerima  Open 11:30-14:00, 18:30-2:00am Weekends until 1:00am Sunday until 11:00pm Closed Mondays and some Sundays  ",

        "post": " 中国台湾料理 味仙 今池本店    Taiwan ramen is a creation not from the country of Taiwan, but from Japan's fourth largest city, Nagoya. The history is fairly straightforward; a chef at a Chinese restaurant wanted something to serve his workers. Nagoya natives are known for having a strong palate, so mixing some of the shop's noodles with an extra spicy soup was an easy choice. Turned out that the dish was quite good, and soon became a regular menu item.  Since then, Taiwan ramen shops have popped up all over Nagoya. It wasn't until a few years ago, when Hanabi created their soupless Taiwan mazesoba, that the rest of the country took note.    Although Misen, the originator of this ramen style, has a few shops around town, I ventured to the honten, the shop that started it all. Take the subway a few stops, then look for the signs or ask a local. Everyone knows this shop.    There was a line of about 15 people, but being a single diner meant I was instantly given a no-thrills seat at the counter. One Taiwan ramen. please!    Simple as it gets. Remember, this was a dish meant for the staff. Ground pork, bean sprouts, and nira are the only toppings.  And, yes, it is hot. Very hot. But it's that hot that lingers until it becomes delicious. Get past the initial wave of pain, and you'll be slurping every last drop.    The bowl seems smaller than your average bowl of ramen. Not an issue, as it's only 630 yen. That's about five bucks.    Misen is, at heart, a Chinese restaurant. They menu is deep, with 40 or 50 dishes to try.    Groups of diners tend to order a bowl of ramen each, and an extra dish per person as well, for a veritable feast.    But, as I was alone, the only other thing I had was some water.    I asked about the California license plates, and they told me that there was a branch in Chinatown, which I don't think is true.  Check another one off the long list of ganso (original) ramen shops.

But I wasn't in the mood. There's got to be some decent ramen out here!    I vaguely remember someone mentioning Yokkaichi. As this station was on the way, I hopped off for a few minutes to have a slurp. The station attendant even gave me a note so I could get back in. Thanks!    Hachinoashiha is the spot to hit. It's highly ranked; the only one with a decent rating of the dozen or so local shops in the area. It is also a lunch-only shop on weekdays, while it opens for a dinner service on the weekend.    Pretty decent. The shop boasts their use of all Japanese ingredients and a non chemical mantra. Very chicken-y, with some nice fried onion as an accent.  They offer a few other items on the menu, but first-timers should get the shio ramen, without a doubt.

This time around, we caught a bus directly from the airport to the remote wilderness, and caught a bus directly back. No chance for anything. Anything except some ramen at the airport's famous Ramen Dojo.    This counts as the fourth shop, out of eight, that I have made it to. The others, Jirocho, Kaiko, and Ichigen were all serviceable, they just lacked a bit in ambiance. This is, after all, the airport.    On a side note, a few years ago I decided I would probably never go back to Las Vegas. Which is why I took an interest in Sora. Number one in Vegas? Is that even a viable ranking?    Well, if this bowl is any indication, then the bar is set very low in Sin City.    Nothing really stood out in this bowl. I feel like you really need to bring your A game when your miso ramen is one of six or seven other miso ramen shops. You need to bring that miso punch. You need something that stands out.    I'm heading to Sapporo again in a few weeks, on another tight schedule. I'll try, try, try to make it to some better spots.

        "post": " Mail order ramen is a thing. And I'm not talking about the omiyage ramen packs, with dried noodles and concentrated soup that you can buy at train stations and tourism offices around the country. An interesting company called Takumen actually packs an entire bowl of real ramen, straight from the shop, into a frozen, cook-at-home kit.  When I first heard about this concept, I immediately thought of the possibilities. Could you ship overseas and serve in some kind of brick and mortar shop? Some kind of amazing shop that has some of Japan's best ramen on their menu?  Of course! And if you live in Singapore, this actually exists. The Takumen Ramen Gallery features six different Japanese bowls, shipped direct from the source.  I suppose this is a sort of sponsored post. The founder of Takumen sent me some bowls to try out at home. Here they are, from my favorite to the ones that didn't do it for me.  1. ど・みそ (Do Miso)    I'm a fan of their Tokyo shop, and the delivered version lived up to expectations. The pack of rich miso hid a massive piece of chashu. Those noodles were thick, and cooked well in my crappy Japanese home kitchen. This will be a theme with these packs; thicker noodles were much easier to cook well.    2. ちばから (Chiba Kara)    As the name implies, Chiba Kara is from Chiba. Though I'm not a real Jirorian (die hard fan of Jiro), this Jiro-kei bowl was rich and filling.  I should also note that each delivered bowl comes with a list of recommended toppings. I didn't add any, but this one recommends bean sprouts, shredded cabbage, and heaps of raw garlic.  にんにく入りますか？    3. 作田家 (Sakutaya)    Sakutaya is a decent Ie-kei bowl, meaning it is Yokohama-style ramen. The signature nori, spinach, and chashu toppings are all included.  4. 本田商店 (Honda Shoten)    And now the thinner noodle bowls. Thicker frozen noodles cook in 5-6 minutes, while the thin noodles are just over a minute. I had a problem, which would probably be remedied if I was a little more careful.  Honda Shoten brought authentic Kyushu tonkotsu ramen to my door. The soup was decadent, and that chashu tender. But I didn't cook the noodles long enough. My bad.  5. 元 (Hajime)    Hajime gets put on the top of many shio ramen lists in Tokyo. The broth is light and full of umami. The original shop's noodles are excellent, thin and firm. A perfect match with the soup. I, unfortunately, cooked them about a minute too long. It was really unfortunate to waste such a stellar bowl.  Sorry!    If you live in Japan, and can decipher the Japanese, you can order many, many different bowls from Takumen.com. Prices are comparable to what you would pay in the shop.  If anyone lives in Singapore, check out the Takumen shop and let me know how it is. It looks like they use the packs, along with some fresh toppings, to recreate the original experience. They have two shops.  Official Site Here.      ",

Sure, their chilled noodle dish was fantastic. Goya, daikon, and a vinegar sesame sauce all came together to help me cool off in the heat.    But the real reason I was here was for the kakigori. Japanese-style shaved ice is amazing. Unlike the stuff you are used to at festivals in America, the stuff in Japan is on another level. Crunchy ice? No way, Japanese-style is finely shaved, akin to fresh powder snow. Sickly sweet syrups? Nope, Japanese-style is usually very lightly sweetened using only fruit, cream, and flavorings like matcha.    And for some reason I can't quite figure out, a few ramen shops are serving up kakigori as part of their summer menus.    Here at Soranoiro, they had Hokkaido strawberry, roasted soybean flour with black sugar, kiwi, and sweetened milk. They had a special Fukushima peach bowl  on this day.  This one was epic. Instead of a regular block of ice, they used milk and fresh cream to make the mountain for snow. It was like eating a cloud. The strawberry matched perfect. Strawberries and cream, Japanese style.  They around only serving this from 1pm to 3pm, and then again from 6pm until around 9pm.    A few other shops do this during the summer. Ones that pop into my mind are Kabo-chan (above) and Neiroya (below). I can't recommend these enough. Come September, expect them to have melted away.    ",

Just outside the heart of Sapporo, this is one of those shops that always has a line, and always runs out of soup.    With shops like Yukikaze and Okami Soup having shown me that Sapporo miso is something worthwhile, I was ready to be blown away.    Like most Hokkaido shops, they have miso, shio, and shoyu on the menu. One bowl of miso please.    Right off the bat, these were the best yellow, curly noodles I've ever had. Springy and full of bite.    The soup was definitely good, but I can't agree with the rest of the country in giving this the coveted number one. The master's roots are at Sumire, and the Sumire/Junren style is my least favorite way of doing miso ramen. The impact is minimal, though I think that is the point. Instead of a salty miso hit, you get a smooth, subtle flavor.    If you are in Sapporo, put this on your short list and decide for yourself.    北海道札幌市豊平区美園10条5丁目3-12 Hokkaido, Sapporo-shi, Toyohira-ku, Misono 10jo, 5-3-12 Closest station: Misono  Open 11:00-15:15, 17:00-19:30 Closed Mondays  ",

What should have been an eight hour marathon turned into a sixteen hour crawl, mostly due to the fact that I kept falling asleep. So when the last episode finished, most ramen shops were closed.    Well, Yamate Ramen fit the bill. The location is a bit strange, on a busy street (Yamate Dori), just far enough away from Shibuya Station to make it officially out of the way. It is also near a branch of Todai University, so I guess that is why it stays open until 3am.    The menu is all over the place, with choices like katsuo shoyu ramen and tomato ramen looking quite tasty. But the other customers in the shop made it a point to convince me to go with the midori ramen; green ramen. The color comes from ユーグレナ, an enzyme-rich algae-like superfood. Healthy!    This one is a winner. The soup base is a creamy tonkotsu with a nice refreshing aftertaste. Heavy, but without the after-effects of eating most heavy soups. I had no problem hopping on my bicycle and riding the five kilometers home.    Good luck with the ticket machine!

Kururi, for me, is a very important shop. When I started this site, back in the end of 2008, the only resource I had was a ranking list of shops from some TV show I managed to find with an internet search. Kururi was that list's number one. And for me, it was the first time I had something that truly blew me away.    The infamous black sign. Kururi had no way of inviting you in. Just a small shop with a blackened wood exterior, next to a tire shop, with a long line.    My ramen guidebook, 最強アメリカ・ラーメン男 東京 極ウマ50店を食べる, is now officially outdated.

Shinasobaya is, at least among hardened ramen lovers, considered one of the most important shops in the story of Japanese ramen.    Sano-san, Shinasobaya's founder, is credited as transforming ramen from a simple dish of Chinese origin into gourmet Japanese cuisine. Of course, this journey meant having disciples who not only work at his shop, but carry on his legacy at shops of their own.    The Shinasobaya in Tsurugamine is one of those shops. I can't imagine the hardships that the master endured (Sano-san was well known for being a harsh perfectionist with both his staff and customers). But it was that hard work, that struggle, that eventually led to this, the perfect bowl.    And, yes, this is the perfect bowl. In the way that Michalangelo's David is the perfect representation of the male form. There's nothing crazy going on. No nouveau toppings, just your standard nori seaweed, menma, and a few sliced green onions.    The chashu is tender, the farm-raised egg cooked and flavored correctly, and the noodles matched perfectly. The wontons are an added bonus.    One of those bowls that really makes you love your ramen adventure.    Expect a bit of a line, and remember they are only open until the soup runs out.      神奈川県横浜市旭区鶴ヶ峰本町1-29-8 Kanagawa-ken, Yokohama-shi, Asahi-ku, Tsurugaminehoncho 1-29-8 Closest station: Tsurugamine  Open 11:00-15:00 (or when the soup runs out) Closed Mondays  ",

With rent being cheap (relatively cheaper) on the north side of Tokyo, it was easy (relatively easier) for this small, eight-seat counter restaurant to open.    I had high hopes going in, and was greeted with this fantastic bowl. It's a simple, niboshi-rich ramen with a surprisingly deep umami aftertaste. Sure, this style is the default trend for shops these days, but there was something unique about the flavors in the bowl at Kinari.  Definitely one to check out if you are into niboshi or live anywhere near Komagome Station on the northern side of the Yamanote Line (the Tokyo loop line).

And when you pair maguro tuna with a light shio broth, you'd better know what you are doing.    The Chinese characters in Gantetsu (巌哲) translates to rocky philosophy. This was fitting, as I was meeting with my friend A from Philoramen. I'll keep his name anonymous, as he is a philosophy researcher whose character may come into question if his ramen obsession was found out by the academic world.    The shop filled with wonderful aromas as chef Yasuyuki Hiramatsu quickly sauteed some raw tuna chunks.  The soup uses local chickens from Shiga Prefecture to give just enough character to match the tuna, all topped with high quality versions of your usual toppings.    Another solid shio ramen in Tokyo. Umami-rich, and the half-cooked bits of fresh tuna could stand on their own, they were that good.    The limited hiyashi bowl was outstanding. Those raw, red sliced of maguro were unbelievably rich. We later found out that it was cold smoked, giving those slices a deep, rich flavor.    Smoking meats needs to be a bigger thing in Tokyo, though I'm not sure if the thousands of neighbors we all live near would be too happy about it.

Five lovely ladies collaborated with five awesome shops to make their own creations. Ramen is historically a male-oriented food, but in recent years the ladies have made it hip to slurp.    My timing was bad, and only two shops were open when I went for a late lunch.    First up was Yurimori-san's collaboration with Garasha. I've never been to this toripaitan shop, so I was curious to see what was going on.    The shop's soup was blended with egg whites to make a thick and fluffy base. Topped with some veggies, and served with a side of curry paste. I'll be honest . .  it was unique. Also, I should note, this was the most popular bowl of the event.    Apologies to anyone who wants to go, this event is long over by the time this post goes up. Keep up to date on ramen happenings over at the Ramen Adventure Facebook page.    Next up was a collaboration between Menya So and a girl named Russian Sato (ロシアン佐藤).    It was a slightly spicy mazesoba with the shop's excellent noodles. On the side was a tomato-dill sauce. It was also . . . unique.    Tokyo is full of fun little ramen collaborations and events. Be sure to check out the next Ramen Girl's Club event. If you can read Japanese, Satoko Morimoto's blog (she's the president) can be found here.  ",

        "post": " Umami    Ramen in Phoenix, Arizona? What's that all about?  Why eat ramen, when you can be eating some nouveax tacos in an old church reformed into a Mexican restaurant?    Or a more traditional chile rellenos at the local spot?    Or the best breakfast burrito in the state? Seriously, Arizona's take on Mexican food added two inches to my waist.    But one can not survive on Mexican food alone. Well, maybe that's not true, but I had made it a mission to check out Umami when I had the chance.  Umami's story is interesting. They actually won a contest for six months of free rent, right next to ASU, and chef Jared Lupin quickly garnered status when they were named one of the best ramen shops in the country. Soon after, a kitchen fire shut them down for repairs. On a side note, one of my best friends in Japan moved back to his Arizona home a few years ago. Missing a taste of Japan, he started slurping at Umami. Random talks led to my name coming up, and Jared has been a follower of Ramen Adventures for some time. Awesome.    Umami features a do-it-yourself approach to the ramen. Choose your tare flavor, then load up on toppings. I was told that a miso paitan was the master's special.    I need to express my concern with the elephant in the room; the above professional photo, stolen from the shop's website, is not very appetizing. I showed this same photo to some ramen friends here in Tokyo, and they thought I was crazy for wanting to come here.  My own photo is lacking in the looks department as well.    My opinion would have to be based heavily on the taste.    In this sense, probably the only real important factor when it comes to a simple bowl of ramen, Umami excels. Just enough kick from the miso on impact. Just enough smooth, creamy aftertaste from the soup. And the umami was there to finish it off. Very satisfying.  My friend loaded his up with all kinds of toppings, but I just went with an egg. Feel free to go minimal or over the top, it's that kind of place.    Apart from the ramen, Umami sports a bar serving up all kinds of sake, shochu, and cocktails. I tried a few one-cups from Kikusui, the global supplier of nihonshu to most of America.    I find that most American ramen shops cater to the local crowd. Umami is right next to Arizona State University, so you can expect a lively, voracious crowd. They have a sumo bowl (4x ramen, max spice, loaded with meats) that only six out of 58 people have been able to finish. They have their regulars; college kids who want their ramen they way they like is. They have plenty of room, even a private area for events.    I wish I could say I'd be back soon, but Arizona is quite a trek from Japan. See you again someday!

        "post": " Ramen Crush ATL    One cool thing about travel by air is that you can often stop off a few times along your route, see a new place, and continue on for the same price as a single destination ticket. So instead of just Tokyo to New York and back, I did New York, Atlanta, Arizona, and Los Angeles.  Why Atlanta? Well, I have a foodie friend living there who wanted to show me around town. Southern barbecue, a Braves game, the MLK memorial, and the world's biggest aquarium.  Oh, and ramen.    Did I mention the world's biggest aquarium?    But this is Ramen Adventures, so I'd better talk about the noodles.  I'm intrigued by the concept of pop-up ramen shops. They don't really exist on the same level in Japan in the way they do in America. The hype around pop-ups is staggering. Huge lines, lottery systems, and upscale venues with craft cocktails seem to be the norm. So when I read that Atlanta had a bit of a ramen pop-up scene (well, two competing shops on Thursday nights), I decided to check it out.    Ramen Crush is held at Ration & Dram, a craft cocktail bar built inside an old industrial warehouse. The place normally serves up fancy bar bites and flights of local beers.  And . . . here comes the ramen.    There were three of us, so we tried one of each bowl. I feel sorry for the guy who got the vegetarian miso. It was a huge mess. Pumpkin and corn.    The tonkotsu was a bit weak, though the toppings were good. I'd like some of that roast pork and menma as a side dish, matched with some good sake.    For what it's worth, I think I liked the shio the best. There were some noticeable umami flavors coming through, enhanced even more by the kimchi and roasted spam. I know it doesn't sound great on paper, but it worked . . . sort of.    Good cocktails though.      Ration & Dram site here. Ramen Crush Facebook here.  ",

        "post": " IVAN Ramen    Before I dish out my praises for Ivan Ramen in New York, a little criticism.  The lighting in the garden is too dim to get a great photo of the ramen. The breakfast ramen, a mazesoba made with cheddar cheese and bacon, is only available for breakfast. I visited for dinner. A friend of a friend who joined us was disappointed when she met me; she thought she was going to meet David Chang.  Now that that is out of the way . . .    Ivan Orkin opened a few years back to much fanfare. There was a lot of hype about ramen at the time, and who better to blow up on the scene than a native New Yorker. A local boy who had kicked serious ass in Japan as the first white guy to really make an impact. The dude had worked in fine dining, then opened his small ramenya in Tokyo, and now he was ready to return.  Ramen had become cool, people had shown their interest, everything was just right.    The shop is seriously funky. Designer Claude Carril took a pop art approach to the shop, blending Japanese imagery with bold colors and a touch of Americana. Love it.    The menu is large, with eleven starters and seven different bowls. We sampled our way through a few things, with the Chinese greens and pork meatballs being some of my favorites.    But if you'd have to choose just one appetizer, go with the roast pork musubi. Bite-size bits of umami madness. The pork is juicy and meaty, the tomato acidic and fruity, and the salted plum sour. Kind of an amazing creation by Orkin.      If you are into cocktails, Ivan Ramen has plenty. I went with a chili-salt rimmed cucumber deal, while my friends tried some sansho flavored beer from Kagua.     And then the ramen.    I, of course, have eaten at Ivan Ramen in Tokyo many times. His ramen is simple, with hints of katsuo in the aftertaste. I had forgotten that katsuo, the basis of most Japanese cooking and what gives many bowls of ramen their intense umami flavors, is a rather rare ingredient outside of Japan. My friend asked what the amazing, smoky, fishy flavor was. For them, slurping at Ivan Ramen was an educational experience. Very cool.  This is where the shio and shoyu ramen shines; in their simplistic refined flavor.    I'm not happy with the photos in this post (see criticism point number one). Not only do they not do the food justice, but I forgot to take a decent shot of everyone's favorite bowl, the triple pork triple garlic mazemen. It's the junkiest bowl, a polar opposite to the shio. Ivan has always been on point with noodles, and though he now has them made for him at Sun Noodle, they are still a custom deal, brimming with whole grain.

        "post": " きしもと食堂    With only one free day in Okinawa, I had to make the most of it. Now, if my life was only about the ramen, I probably would have stayed in Naha, slurping at the spots that people had recommended. I had a list of a few of those.  But the empty, ocean-side roads and promise of Okinawa's more local noodle dish were all I could think about. Motobu is a city just about an hour from Naha, and is considered the home of sokisoba. Sokisoba is a simple dish; udon-like noodles in a very light dashi soup, topped with soki (stewed pork spareribs), sanmainiku (stewed pork belly), and kamaboko (fish cake).    Kishimoto and Yanbaru are the two shops that seem to get the most exposure. Lucky for me, both shops serve small size bowls, and both shops are a five minute drive from each other.  Wake up, eat two bowls of sokisoba, then spend the rest of the day riding around on a fast motorcycle. Did I mention that Okinawa was a lovely 29 degrees C, while Tokyo was around 15?    500 yen is a steal! Be warned that the small bowls are more like a normal bowl, and the normal bowls are massive.    To be honest, I'm not big on these type of noodles. They are more of an udon style, and they lack the bite and ability to soak up soup that ramen noodles often have. But those toppings! Fatty pieces of stewed pork and some simple fish cakes. For me, and everyone I know, this is the real allure of Okinawan soba. Of course, you can get stewed pork belly at most Okinawan restaurants, but I really like that the light soup cuts the sweetness of the meat.    If you find yourself in Motobu (it's where the famous aquarium is), do yourself a favor and check out some soki, you won't regret it.    And go in November! I stopped on my way back to Naha to watch the sun set from a fancy resort, and I was the only person on the beach.    I should also not that this one isn't the honten. The original shop is just a few blocks away, but I was confused!      沖縄県国頭郡本部町伊野波350-1 Okinawa-ken, Kunigami-gun, Motobo-cho, Inoha 350-1 Closest station: None  Open 11:00-19:00  ",

Toy Runs happen all around the world, and we are happy to be doing one in Tokyo. A Toy Run is a bunch of motorcycle riders collecting toys and donations, dressing as Santas (bad-ass motorcycle riding Santas!), and driving to an orphanage to deliver the goods. We spend the day with the kids, playing games and eating pizza, and they get a ton of awesome gifts. How cool is that!    We've been doing the Tokyo Toy Run since 2009, and the group has gotten very large. We've had close to a hundred bikes at times. A hundred bikes covered with presents, rolling down the highway, is a sight to see.    Here was my donation from a few years back.    Loaded up on the bike and ready to go!    Our event has become larger and larger every year, and Ramen Adventures has become larger and larger every year. I'm hoping to capitalize on the generosity of my amazing readers (that's YOU!), so I'm making a call for donations.  I've already received a few donations, and every yen is going into toys for this event.  If you would like to donate, please do so via PayPal to my address, ramenamerican@gmail.com. Yen or dollars, whichever you prefer.    We will most likely head to ramen after the event, and while I can't post photos of the children, I hope to have a report about a tasty bowl.

The Kawasaki Z800 is smooth, fast, and uncomfortable. You've been warned.    But while my choice of motorcycles didn't end up being to my taste, my choice in ramen was spot on. Stripe Noodle has been on my radar ever since ramen superstar Miyazaki-san from Soranoiro helped open it. Beef ramen topped with a steak. It might sound strange, but when you realize that the shop is right next to a US military base, you can see the appeal.    A fantastic bowl. Despite the unusual topping, all the parts are there; great noodles and an umami-rich soup.    There are quite a number of ramen shops in Naha, the main city on Okinawa island. But with my bike, I had other plans. Plans to head north in search of sokisoba, Okinawa's own noodle dish.    But for those who dare not venture into the unknown, Stripe is a must-try in Okinawa.

        "post": " らーめん大    Ramen Dai is a chain of Jiro-kei shops that I would probably never have gone to. I tend to avoid chains, and I tend to avoid Jiro-kei. But today was special.    Ramen 道 is a weekly TV spot I'm part of. Each week, I'm joined by a member of AKB48 on my ramen road. It's goofy fun, airing live on TBS in Japan at about 1am on Sunday, but also broadcast live on YouTube. The show is called Tokyo Extra. Check it out if you can! #tokyoextra    Hamming it up with Rena Nozawa this time.    One aspect of Jiro-kei shops is the free vegetable topping. I say vegetable, but in all but a few cases it is just bean sprouts and a couple pieces of cabbage. Once I think I saw a sliver of carrot. You can order a veritable mountain of the stuff.      What did I tell you, a mountain. This is actually the Tower Size bowl. This shop is near Tokyo Sky Tree, the 634 meter tall expression of man's greatness that is next door to the ramen shop. So it makes sense that they would capitalize on this with a massive bowl.    Here's a rare glimpse of a bowl without the vegetables. Heavy noodles and a heavy soup. See all that fat in there? It tastes amazing at first, but Jiro-kei can be a rough endeavor. If you want to give this style a try, I'd say check the main Jiro shop in Mita, or go to my favorite Senrigan.  Check out the video here. Please comment and subscribe if you like it. If the TV network sees interest, we may get to film more episodes.

        "post": " 煮干中華ソバ イチカワ    The weather for late October was surprisingly warm and clear. The perfect riding weather. I put out a quick call for a ramen ride, but with short notice no one had the time. A solo ride out to Tsukuba was no problem, especially for the bowl at Ichikawa.    The line at 11am, 30 minutes before the shop opens, was almost 40 deep. What is even more impressive is that Ichikawa only serves 80 bowls a day before they close.    This is what they came for. One of the most sought after bowls of niboshi ramen in Japan. The master wore a shirt proclaiming the addictive quality of niboshi, and I agree. Soups made with copious amounts of dried sardines have an almost drug-like umami effect.    If you don't absolutely love these flavors, you might want to reconsider. Even the vinegar is spiked with the good stuff.    And the egg. I watched as the only other employee - I'm assuming it was the master's wife - used a syringe to inject the shop's tare seasoning liquid directly into the yolk before serving.    Wow. I used to say that high quality eggs were hard to give any sort of ranking to. Good was good. But now I have a number one.    Tsukuba isn't considered much of a rider's hangout. Regardless, the ride over the mountain was nice, and a quick dip into a local onsen hot spring was a necessity.    By the way, for those who are concerned about the line. In line at 11am, the shop opened at 11:30, sat down at around 12:30, and was out the door just before 1pm. Good luck.

This is one of those only-in-Japan shops, with only five counter seats in a shop that probably should have only been for four. The one ramen master works at his own pace, making sure each bowl is on point.    The menu is shio tsukemen and shio ramen, though everyone goes for the tsukemen here.    A mix of nine different salts, from France, Italy, Mongolia, Okinawa, Hiroshima, and Koichi.    Fantastic.    If you only have one bowl of shio tsukemen, make this one it. They are open late into the evening in an interesting part of town. Yotsuya Sanchome if full of hidden gems; bars and restaurants that no guidebooks seem to cover.    It turned out, though, that my friends had actually recommended Toka's new shop, located just around the corner. Their second brand is an all tai ramen. A 100% fish soup from these guys is probably going to be amazing as well. Stay tuned.  By the way, I should mention that the line here moves incredibly slow. There were two guys in front of me, and I waited at least 30 minutes. Worth it for me, but maybe not for you.      東京都新宿区荒木町8 Tokyo, Shinjuku-ku, Arakicho 8 Closest station: Yotsuyasanchome  Open 18:00-3:00am Closed Sundays  ",

        "post": " Fukuoka Ramen Show    My work had me in Fukuoka for a day, and it just so happened that the Fukuoka Ramen Show was happening. Score! I'm usually not so hot on these events, as the quality of the bowls is all over the place. Taking time off to visit them is hit or miss. But when the event is literally next door to where you are working and sleeping, you have to go.    Since this is a festival outside of Tokyo, there were a few famous Tokyo shops present. Pass! I went straight to the local collaborations. First up is one where Ippudo and a popular chicken stew place teamed up. Take a thick soup and top it with some delectable pieces of chicken. The karaage fried chicken and chicken meatball were a legit topping on Ippudo's solid bowl.    There were four local bowls at this festival, but I only had room for two.    Sorry Nagi! See you in Golden Gai!    For the second bowl, I went with Saga Prefecture's ramen group's bowl. Saga is known for being a dull place (they have a famous song about how dull it is). Wrong! Saga has the best nori seaweed in the country. When I asked the staff if they were using their prefecture's famous product, they were so happy about my local knowledge that they threw in an extra sheet.    Nice picture? Most ramen events have a photography area these days. #fukuokaramenshow    I've stayed in Saga a few times, and was always underwhelmed. But after this great bowl, I did a little research. Saga is one of those places where you need a car and a little knowledge. While the vicinity of the main station can be quiet, a short drive away is full of hidden gems.    I really love all that nori.    The event is over, but you can keep tabs on their next event here.    ",

With a background in gourmet Italian, he has what it takes to cook anything he wants, and cook it well. His focus on ramen had paid off with a shop that has a perpetual lineup.    On Fridays, and only Fridays, the shop transforms from Motenashi Kuroki to Murasaki Kuroki. And the regular shio is replaced by shoyu. Duck shoyu to be exact.    Kamo, or duck, often finds its way into more traditional buckwheat soba dishes. A bowl of kamosoba at an old, countryside soba shop is an amazing thing. The soup has less of an impact, and more of a deepness, serving to highlight the fresh noodles and roasted duck.  The ramen here is a reflection of that dish.    You won't have the initial hit of flavor that most great ramen has. Instead, it's the warmth and smoothness that you notice. Kuroki's noodles are amazing, made in the shop, with a texture that won this bowl one of the highest ranking on any country-wide list of ramen shops. You can choose thin noodles or hand pressed flat noodles. The flat noodles are the way to go.    Expect lines. But what better way to spend your Friday night than hunched over a bowl like this.

And certainly not a difficult one to remedy. The second shop, their new one, is only half a block away.    This one is also a shio, or salt based soup. But what sets it apart from the rest of the chicken and pork loving world is that the soup is made exclusively with tai, a kind of snapper fish. Fish is the only animal that goes into this one, meaning that the other ingredients, kelp and vegetables, need to be perfectly balanced to work.    And they are. This is an elegant, beautiful bowl of ramen. Just a touch of yuzu zest for a bit of an aroma.    I spoke with the chef, and he assured me that the only meat is the single piece of chashu on top.

Located way out in Nara Prefecture, It was required that I spend an extra night in Osaka after my work finished, wake up early, and line up well before the shop opened. In case you aren't familiar with the lay of the land, Nara is just less than an hour from Osaka.    Outside, the sandwich board lets you know; 10 people will be about 25 minutes, 20 people equals 50 minutes, and more than 20 people is more than an hour. At 10am (they open at 11), I was number 12. Two minutes after I got in line, there were about 30.  This was on a weekday.  You are warned.    Shoyu or shio, it's your choice. Make sure you get the chashumen for the full effect.    What a beautiful bowl. It wasn't as creamy as I thought it would be. They hit the soup with a hand blender just before serving to froth it up a bit. Underneath the foam is a deep shoyu soup. Amazing stuff. Rare, peppered chashu lining the bowl is their signature.  This bowl looks a lot like one of the best ramen shops in Japan, Ore no Ramen Appare, which actually isn't too far away. If you hit up both shops, you would have eaten at the #2 and #6 ramen shops in Japan, if you follow the popular rankings.    Yes, this shop is out of your way. But if you come here early, you'll be set for a nice day in nearby Nara, one of Japan's famous historical areas. There are temples, quaint restaurants, a big Buddha, and plenty of the area's most famous draw; friendly deer.    I love Nara. People say it is like a mini-Kyoto, but I think of it as a more relaxing experience. The entire place is green and natural, and a short hike up the hill puts you far enough from the city to feel at peace.    I've been hitting off all the big ones lately.

This shop feels like an old shack was engulfed by a modern building. Come to think of it, that is a pretty good description of Osaka.    Under-cooked pork, under-cooked chicken, and a half-cooked egg. This is great stuff. All matched with a heavier-than-average chicken shio soup. Aromatic pink peppercorns work to mellow the whole bowl, and the aftertaste is pure umami.    It's a lot of food, but make sure you get the extra toppings. It's called 塩のキラメキ, shio no kirameki on the menu.    Official site here.      大阪府大阪市中央区高津 1-2-11 Osaka, Osaka-shi, Chuo-ku, Kozu 1-2-11 Closest station: Nippombashi  Open 11:00-14:30, 18:00-22:00  ",

As are the rest of the shops in the Gamushara group, a collection of ramen shops celebrating the diverse ramen scene from Niigata Prefecture, a few hundred kilometers north of Tokyo.    One thing about the original Gamushara, out in Hatagaya, is their heavy use of ginger. Taking inspiration from a local Niigata-style, the soup is heavy on the impact, and the aftertaste is full of ginger heat.    Well, now the miso spot becomes a bit of a ginger spot two days a week. This one is lighter than their other one, so there is no reason to be worried about a ginger overload.  The tokusei ramen (特製ラァメン) comes with an egg, and extra slices of meat. Probably the best choice here.    Of course, a week after I went I saw the master, and he said I should really have gotten the tsukemen.      東京都渋谷区千駄ヶ谷5-29-7 Tokyo, Shibuya-ku, Sendagaya 5-29-7 Closest station: Shinjuku  Open Wednesday and Thursday 11:00-10:00  ",

Ramen in Tokyo is progressively getting better and better, in my opinion, and the ramen scene overseas is following suit.    My goal with Ramen Adventures has been to entertain and inform. The blog format works for writing and photography. Two posts a week, Mondays and Thursdays. This is a pace I can live with.    Not everyone is big on drawn out posts with words and more than one photo. I know that there are Instagrammers, Youtubers, and those who just live on Twitter. Ramen Adventures is on all of those, with each one a little different. I'm grateful for the support on whichever social media platform you love.    Instagram:            A photo posted by Ramen Adventures (@ramenadventures) on Nov 20, 2015 at 7:50am PST          I don't like live-posting anything, but dozens of people have told me that I need to be on Instagram. So I've been posting five shots every Friday, with some random bits of culinary Japan thrown in throughout the week for good measure.  YouTube:  I'm actually doubled up on YouTube at the moment. My Ramen Adventure channel, produced by Yummy Japan, has been a bit slow of late. I'm hoping to change that in the coming year, with my goal of 50 videos in sight.    I'm also working with #tokyoextra, produced by Tokyo Broadcasting. These collaboration videos are broadcast over the air and on YouTube live on Sunday nights in Japan. I've been teaming up with some of the girls from AKB48 to introduce a variety of shops.    If either of these channels appeal to you, please subscribe. The producers of these videos were expecting that a high traffic blog like Ramen Adventures would mean hundreds of thousands of views, but that isn't really the result.  Twitter:  I'm on Twitter @ramenadventures, but this is just an automatic system that tweets when a post goes live.  Facebook:  Facebook is where I post about events, my favorite bowls, and where I have the most direct interaction.  https://www.facebook.com/ramenadventure/      Happy 2015 holidays, and have a great New Year! 明けましておめでとう。今からよろしくお願いします。  ",

I'll be honest, of the five or six places in Tokyo that serve a real vegan bowl of ramen, only two are good; Soranoiro and here at Oka. The other shops are downright awful.    I was very happy with this one. The soup is a light tomato broth, topped with colorful, crisp vegetables.    Notice that strange looking bowl? Well, when your noodles are gone, you are given a small bowl of rice, and can pour some soup in.    The shop even has the Halal stamp of approval for their meat dishes, making this an extremely accessible shop for travelers.    Speaking of meat, their normal bowl is outstanding. The soup is made with red snapper and tomato, topped with a yuzu citrus foam, and served with crispy fried chicken on the side. I ate this bowl as part of a TV shoot recently. Check it out here:      If you aren't a vegan, go for that one, as the fish really adds a lot of depth to the flavor profile.  Oka is a new shop, and is already a hit with the foreign community.      東京都新宿区新宿1-11-7 Tokyo, Shinjuku-ku, Shinjuku 1-11-7 Closest station: Shinjuku-Gyoenmae  Open 11:30-15:00, 18:00-21:00 Closed Mondays  ",

The kind of place you would never know about, save for their recent mention in the 2016 Michelin Guide. Burari was given a nod in the Bib Gourmand section of the guide, a section devoted to cheap, yet high quality eats.    Is this Michelin quality ramen? Sure, why not.    Burari is a chicken ramen place, with simplicity being the key. The yellow row on the ticket machine is creamy soup, the green is clear soup.    We tried one of each, and they were both quite nice. Very simple, without much of a deep impact. The kind of ramen that would exist down a little street in a less popular part of town. A place with happy regulars, and the occasional happy random customer.

But, if they are closed, Menyashokudo is a nearby choice.    The shop is done up in 昭和レトロ style; Showa retro. Old signage, retro candy, cute festival masks. Definitely a fun place.    And while the soup looks simple, it is rather deep.    Their menu claims that their kodawari lies in three parts; noodles, soup, and heart. The soup was a highlight. Taking about 10 hours to make, it's rich and deep. The noodles are homemade with Hokkaido flour. And the heart? Just looking around at the families slurping away in this retro shop made it clear that, yes, that is as important as the taste.  The menu has many bowls, but the simple kakesoba let's you savor just the noodles and soup.

Some of Ida Shoten's accolades:  #13 in the country according to Tabelog A 95.134 rating on the ramen database TRY magazine #3 shoyu, #7 shio, #1 light tsukemen A massive line every day    Yes, the line here is long. On a warm Saturday in November, I waited over two hours. Be prepared.  I should also note that this shop, though technically in Kanagawa Prefecture, is very far from Tokyo. The fastest trip by train involves riding the Shinkansen bullet train, and takes about an hour and a half.    The menu is simple. Top row is shoyu, followed by shio, with tsukemen just under that. What to eat, what to eat? One of each sounds good.    This shoyu is on another level. Master Ida-san trained at famed Shinasobaya, and it shows. A deep shoyu sits underneath that golden layer of aromatic chicken oil. On many levels, this could be considered a perfect bowl of ramen; every detail is accounted for. Thick-cut menma along side thick-cut chashu. The special version also came with slow-cooked chicken slices and shrimp wontons.  Despite the distance from central Tokyo, this one is a must-hit for ramen lovers.    The shio is up there as well. Notice how he uses slightly different toppings? While the robust shoyu has thick cut menma bamboo shoots, the lighter shio uses a thinner, more delicate one. Also, the bowls are different shapes, meant to affect the aroma and slurpability. This is where my fellow ramen nerds and I geek out.    Oh, they were having a limited bowl of duck shoyu, so we tried that as well. I've had a few bowls of duck shoyu recently, and when done right, it's fantastic. This might have been a reason for the huge line that day.    The tsukemen is a different beast all together. If it looks complicated, well, it is. So complex, in fact, that you need a nine step instruction manual to do it right.    Sprinkle some salt on the noodles. Eat the noodles a la carte. The noodles are sitting in a light konbu dashi that deserves to be tasted alone. Taste just the soup. Rich, isn't it? Eat the tsukemen like a normal person normally would. These toppings are amazing! Now dip the noodles in the shoyu soup, then sprinkle with salt. Eat it! Finish it! Pour the remaining soups together and drink it down. Tell a friend!　行くべ！    But, to be honest, I didn't like this one at all!  The konbu dashi that the noodles sit in was so rich that it became slimy. The word slimy sounds bad in English, while the Japanese onomatopoeia for the word ネバネバ, neba neba, is used to describe many tasty foods. I'm not a huge fan, an aspect I blame on being raised in a Western household where slippery, slimy foods were never on the menu. I'll eat the stuff, but I'm not going out of my way for the likes of natto, okra, or grated yam (tororo).  I've been told by EVERY other ramen nerd that this tsukemen is one of the best in Japan. That overabundance of konbu means and overabundance of umami. Even though I don't recommend it, I kind of recommend it.    You could easily make a day out in Yugawara. There are plenty of onsen, natural hot springs, in the area. Dopponoyu, Japan's largest foot bath, isn't far from Ida Shoten. And in nearby Atami is one of my favorite art museums in Japan, the MOA. Sounds like a perfect day to me!    神奈川県足柄下郡湯河原町土肥2-12-14 Kanagawa-ken, Ashigarashimagun, Yagawaramachi, Doi 2-12-14 Closest station: Yugawara  Open 11:00-15:00 Closed Mondays  ",

But I'm not afraid to admit that my palate is unaccustomed to this style. I've had some very good bowls before, and a lot of decent bowls. In the realm of decent, all these Hakata-style bowls are a blur.    Horin is strictly decent. I had a busy day of work the next morning, and this was the closest shop with a high rating near the hotel. I wanted to visit the famed yatai of the area, portable food carts serving ramen and drinks, but those are more of a late night thing.    Horin was just what I needed before bed.    I know this review isn't of much use, but like I said, it's a sea of decentness.  I would love some recommendations for shops in Fukuoka.

But maybe I just had the wrong one. The spicy tantanmen was topped with fake meat (some kind of gluten), and the soup was heavy on the soy milk. Both of those things are things I avoid.  The menu has half a dozen ramen varieties. So, like I said, maybe I just picked the wrong one.    But the rest of the menu at 6BT, along with the funky cafe vibe, make for a good time. Grab one of their jar salads (a trend I've been told), and match it with an antioxidant fruit smoothie. Feel better about yourself because some of the menu is organic. You can even buy natural detox juice kits if you feel bad about what you put into your body the week before.

Their menu is deep, with a list of limited bowls that I can't even read. What the heck is 藍貝? Some kind of mussel? Ah, and there's the never-used Chinese character for crab, 蟹. And the last one is razor clam.  So, yeah, their ever-changing limited menu on this day includes four kinds of amazing seasonal seafood dishes.    But we were focusing on pork. By we, I mean AKB48 member Rena Nozawa and myself, filming with #tokyoextra. The shop's shabushabu ramen is topped with, you guessed it, shabu shabu. By the way, the Chinese characters for this dish are 涮肉麺.    The soup is light and aromatic, with plenty of yuzu to keep it fresh. The noodles? Top of the line homemade. Every time I come here I forget how amazing they are. I have a few foodie friends who are high up in the game, and they swear by this shop, making a trek here every time they visit Tokyo.  But how to you make it even better? Get a side of the shop's kakuni, stewed pork. Kakuni is rich and succulent, and Suzuran's melts in your mouth.    The lineup isn't horrible on a weekday, but expect a short wait.

Put it on a lean piece of nigiri sushi, and you'll feel the burn. Put it on some fatty wagyu steak, and it's like eating a pungent forest.    Nukashi takes advantage of this property of wasabi by covering your bowl in lightly grilled fatty pork pieces. This, added to the fact that the tonkotsu gyokai soup is already quite heavy, and you're left with an interesting bowl indeed.    My advice, and this goes for any bowl of ramen at any shop, is to eat about half of it without any spice. Then, flavor away to your heart's content. At Nukashi, that means wasabi, wasabi, wasabi.    Fun shop. This was actually for a TV shoot. I'm not thrilled when my TV shoots take me to shops that I haven't sampled before. You are pretty much required to love the ramen when the cameras are rolling. For me, personally, I will never endorse a place with bad ramen, but work is work. I pretty much knew that that roasted pork would be good, if anything else, but in the end the entire bowl was solid. Sign of relief. Check out the video!      And in total Ikebukuro fashion, they were filming some sort of gangster movie outside the shop in a separate shooting.

I like this list. Personally, it gives me a solid selection of Osaka and Fukuoka shops to check out this year, as well as a few more in Tokyo that I haven't been to. Goals in life are good.    This list isn't a direct representation of Tabelog's user base. Tabelog operates on a 5 star system, and is purely based on user's ratings. Generally, anything with more than 4 stars is considered an amazing restaurant. In my dealings with food of all types, this is normally true. But, if you look at the flat out rankings, some shops that are in the general top 10 for ramen, such as Orenoramen Apare, aren't in this list of 50 at all. I'm not sure who curated this list, but I would love to know their reasons for leaving off the shop that I consider my favorite in Japan. And Tsuta, despite their Michelin star and high numerical score, looks to have been snidely added at the very bottom.    I was also really happy that this list re-ignited memories of some of my old favorites. In the search for ramen, we sometimes neglect some shops after visiting once. Number 28, Ranchu, is a perfect example . . . and it's only a 10 minute bicycle ride from my house.    46 / 50 is almost there. Wish me luck!          ",

The menu is totally different, focusing on lighter shio styles.  The top of the ticket machine, from left to right, is niboshi shio, anchovy mazesoba, kakesoba, and a shoyu that will come in the future.  I tried a couple bowls, starting with the anchovy mazesoba. Mix it up!    The anchovy flavor was lighter than what you would expect, and the flat noodles are an uncommon choice for this style of soupless ramen. I'd recommend it if it wasn't for their other menu item.  The real winner here is the kakesoba, ramen with nothing but soup and noodles. Why not include a plethora of tasty toppings? This style of ramen let's the soup speak out for itself.    And what a soup it is! Made with Japanese abalone and spiny lobster, the kakesoba is pure essence of the sea. I gotta see it again!    Exploding with umami, and just a splash of the ocean. This is broth at the same level as some at Tokyo's high end kaiseki restaurants. Yes, iseebi, Japanese spiny lobster is very expensive. Yes, awabi, abalone, ain't cheap either. But this bowl is only 1000 yen. Limited to 30 a day.    Show it again!    I've grown to love natural umami flavors more and more. Take a sip, and feel the aftertaste as you exhale. It's hard to define umami; is it a meaty taste or just a mouth-feel. Regardless of how you describe the 6th taste sensation, it is pure joy.

It was ranked number one on some list somewhere, a list that inspired me to start Ramen Adventures.  Well, the space has been reopened as Otsukaya, serving a bowl that is related to Kururi, yet very different.    Ramen or tsukemen are your choices. A placard outside describes their soup as ドロドロ系辛みそ; mega-thick spicy miso.    I need a word stronger than mega. Colossal? Monumental? Insane?  This stuff is intense. The miso tastes like it was derived from Kururi's, and then rendered down with spice until you can stand a pair of chopsticks upright in it (which you should never do in Japan). The spice isn't too crazy, but I couldn't finish this one due to the thickness.  It's worth a visit if you are a big ramen nerd, but for others, you might want to think twice.

I have a confession to make, I really wanted to dislike this place. You see, there is an amazing ramen shop in Ginza called Kagari. Their shop is almost a secret, and if it wasn't for the massive line down a nondescript alleyway, you would have no idea. There are no signs, save for a tiny そば marker indicating noodles of some sort. Kagari is amazing, and I love watching people reactions as they pass the huge line, having no clue why people are there.  Well, Tsukiichi jumped on the chance and opened directly above Kagari. Then, they erected a giant \"らーめん\" banner above Kagari. I'm not sure if they are trying to ride the coattails of one of my favorite places in the country or not, but I didn't like it.    I've been to Kagari a few times since Tsukiichi opened, and have never seen anyone in the place.    The bowl was ok. How can you lose with grilled scallops and fresh yuzu peel? Nowhere near the level of that amazing shop on the 1st floor, though.

Topped with all manner of things (in this case a kind of starchy root and pig inards). Love the stuff!    Wait, you thought I could get away with taking a ramen-break?  Turns out there is a ramen shop next door, managed by the same people, that will bring you a bowl after you finish your okonomiyaki. The ramen shop itself had a line of about 10 people outside, so this was a score.    Araumatei's namesake bowl is a tonkotsu shoyu that was, fortunately, lighter than average. Shime ramen, ramen served after a meal, is best if it isn't motor-oil-thick. That's just my opinion, though. Nice chashu and a smooth umami aftertaste as well.

For those who don't know what it is like in Japan, the girls buy chocolate for all the guys in their lives, from friends to colleagues to boyfriends. Something got a little lost in translation, and this holiday is all about marketing to the masses, as many holidays are. Regardless of how you feel about the day, it's a big deal to some.      Ramen shops even get in on the fun. This year, at MENSHO TOKYO, they add dark chocolate to a spicy, peppery lamb soup. This is a limited bowl, only available until February 14th. Better act fast!    The soup is inspired by Toyama Black, a style that uses black pepper and dark shoyu to give a noodle-staining color to the soup.    Melt in some chocolate, and top with roasted Iberico pork for an intense dish.    Surprisingly, this one was pretty good. The spices outweigh the chocolate, much the way Mexican mole does.  As always, noodles are way above average at any Mensho shop.    Definitely not something I'd crush every day, but not something I wouldn't crush once in a while.    Head to my original review of  MENSHO TOKYO for shop info.  ",

It's cold out, this place is a 40 minute drive from central Osaka, and ramen served in a plastic bowl tends to add a lot of meh to an otherwise good bowl.    But here I was. Actually, the organizers personally invited me when we met by chance at another ramen event, so I felt obliged.    As usual, about 2/3 of the shops were from outside of Osaka; a chance to locals to try something from exotic Tokyo and beyond. The other shops were collaborations. Sign me up with the latter.    The first collab I was into was betweem 縁乃助商店 and ラーメン小僧. Kozu, is an excellent shop serving mega-thick soup in Osaka. They share this love of noko soup with Ennosukeshoten. Both are run by young ramen masters. Blended with miso from Hokkaido, this one cut through the cold. A nice start.          I was intrigued by the bowl at ラーメンこがね家, Koganeya, simply because they had won some TV competitions. I know, I know, this is a horrible way to judge a bowl. I feel like the only TV shows that aren't rigged are the ones that I personally appear on, and even those tend to make creative edits to achieve whatever the director thinks will make for good television.  Anyways, this one was lackluster.    Insert your own caption.    I inadvertently poured in a 神辛, god-level-spice amount of homemade chili oil in the collaboration bowl from Sapporo shop マルエス and local Strike-ken.    But it wasn't as hot as I'd thought. Another decent miso bowl that was great on one of the first cold nights of the season.    The event is long over, but keep an eye for some 2016 events in Osaka, there are many like this planned.

In the ramen world, my young men will work at a ramen shop for a few years before going off to open their own. This is common practice, and the bonds made while working under a ramen master are often taken full advantage of. A support network is built.    Ru uses a lot of the same niboshi that Saikoro uses, though the flavor is all their own. A bit lighter, but still with that awesome fishy punch that everyone loves.  Notice how the naturo has the little swirl in the middle? I was told recently, by none other than the owner of Saikoro, that it should face the customer and look like the の Japanese symbol. の is the possessive, meaning that it is now your bowl. Look for it next time you slurp.

This was an event from Morimoto-san, the power behind the ramen girl's group. A bit of a talk, some bowls of ramen, and unique cocktails were the plan. Everything was revolving around Shimane Prefecture, on the other side of Japan.    Morimoto-san was followed by Russian Saito, the competitive eater. Yeah, that petite lady can crush about 10kg of food at once.    Miyazaki-san gave a talk about Shimane. Shimane is probably more remote than Hokkaido, and a lot of nice products are produced there. A lot of rice and tofu, apparently.    Yep, the ramen was an . . . interesting . . . one. It tasted like pure tofu with a seasoned, deep fried rice ball in the middle. Actually, I personally don't eat tofu, so this one was strange for me. Also, the choice to go vegan could have been skipped. Mix this one with a nice niboshi broth and you'd have something you could sell.    But this is a one-off event, so you can't really have expectations of normal. I'd actually prefer something odd for the next event of this nature.    The cocktails were as unique as the ramen.    A shiso and daikon mojito. Not bad.    Info about the PR Bar can be found here.

We've seen this taken to the extreme with junk-style ramen, so I'm rarely surprised by anything new.    Never say never. The sheer vastness of options at Mitsuboshi was a shock.    Choose from the list or make your own. Number one looks pretty good, a carbonara version with bacon, cheese, and egg, but we were here for something else.    The shop's original wagyu beef sauce, with all the trimmings.    And by trimmings, I mean fish powder, spicy crisped rice, peanuts, banana chips, seaweed powder, fried onions, and chopped green onions. Yes, I said banana chips.  You mix it up, vigorously, to not only spread those flavors, but to activate the gluten in the noodles. The sloppy mess is pure junk food, and totally tasty.    I'll let you discover the rest of the toppings on your own.    Go ahead and add some cheese and butter if you are up for it.    By the way, this was for another edition of #tokyoextra.

This is a one menu item shop. Go for nami, the smallest size. It was plenty.    Toyama black is defined by the ultra-dark soy sauce and black pepper. Be sure to mix it up a bit before you slurp.  Shoyu-lovers rejoice! This one is so deep, so in-your-face. The soup soaks into everything, and the flavors are extreme.    I tried another Toyama Black from Iroha before at their Ikebukuro shop, and have to say that Taiki blew it away.    Not very crowded on a Sunday afternoon, which was surprising considering the sheer number of famous people who have been here.    Unfortunately, I think Taiki is a default go-to for TV shows that are trying to do a local-flavor type of show about Toyama.

Tsumugu is the #9 ramen shop in the whole of Japan according to the popular food ranking site Tabelog. Out of over 51,000, they are in the top ten.    The problem here is accessibility. Located in an obscure part of northern Osaka, Tsumugu is only open for lunch, and only open on weekdays.  So I did the only thing possible; caught the 6:00am bullet train from Tokyo, transferred to a local line, walked 20 minutes from the station, and waited in line. An hour before opening, there were about 20 people who probably hadn't traveled so far.    The things we do for our passions!    Well, it's a stellar bowl. Homemade noodles (of course) that match quite well witht he preservative free (of course) soup. It's a thick, creamy chicken and seafood soup here at Tsumugu. A style you see in many places, done to near perfection. The menu has two choices, light and heavy soups. Almost every customer was slurping the thicker of the two. Probably the best choice.    When I left, the line had tripled. With an expected wait of a few hours, make sure you get here early.  I spoke with a few native Osaka folks after eating here, and most of them had barely heard of this place. I wonder how it is ranked so highly, when there are many, many shops comparable to this one. One explanation is that Tabelog users love cost performance, and the 600 yen bowl at Tsumugu could be the best value for money in the country.      大阪府茨木市宇野辺2丁目1-24 Osaka, Ibaraki-shi, Unobe 2-1-24 Closest station: Senrioka  Open 11:00-14:00 Closed on the weekends      ",

Then this happened.    We just missed it. We salvaged the ramen adventure by going to a local unknown, but in my heart I was really hoping to try Kintoki.    So I came back!    Oh man, I'm glad I came back. This is chicken ramen kicked up to the highest level.    The shop's name can be translated as golden time, and that is exactly what this one was. A golden bowl of chicken soup, touched with some amazing chicken oil, a deep flavor profile, and some solid toppings.    But wait, their fame in the past was more about their soupless tantanmen.  Another bowl, please!    Oh man, oh man, oh man. I can never get enough of this style.    Remember, they usually run out of soup before they are meant to close.

        "post": " 中華そば よしかわ    I managed to drag the usual suspects out on another ramen ride. The problem with many of these rides is that shops open at 11am, and require a boring ride through a major city's traffic. More hardcore riders are up at dawn and well into the mountains by this time.    Luckily, the usual suspects had been out drinking the night before, and a late start paired with a great bowl of ramen was their idea of a good time.  Mine, too.    Why Yoshikawa? Although it has been on my list of shops to check out for a while, their recent #23 spot on a popular nation-wide ranking list made them a must-slurp.    A must-slurp indeed.  This is one is fantastic. The soup is an all natural (無化調) blend of four different dried sardines from all over the country. This is balanced with an shoyu seasoning blend, giving the soup a big impact, and an equally big umami aftertaste.    Be sure to get a side of the iwashidon (いわし丼), a bowl of rice topped with sardines.    Yoshikawa is a relatively new shop, less than two years now, but they have built up a lot of critical success. Expect a bit of a line, though their location detracts from this.    On the ticket machine, the usual upper-left choice was a winner, though the shop has quite a few other choices. You'll be hit with one big choice, though, black or white. They each use a different type of soy sauce. The black was deeper, so I'd suggest that one.    Or just get one of each.      埼玉県上尾市南97-5 Saitama-ken, Ageo-shi, Minami 97-5 Closest station: Kita-Ageo  Open 11:00-15:00. 17:00-21:00 Saturdays 11:00-21:00 Closed on Sundays  ",

Most people couldn't tell you much beyond that, but as I've been here a few times, I knew that people were lining up in droves for something else . . .    Chicken! 骨付鶏 to be exact. Well, I waited in line for this, the most famous chicken in town, as part of my quest to not only eat ramen all over Japan, but to eat local favorites as well. This overly-oily piece of salty meat was a huge disappointment. How do you even eat it? No knives were given, and the meat was quite tough. I ended up splattering spiced oil in my eye as I tried to rip it apart with my teeth.  Immediately as I stepped outside, I knew I needed something to get the taste out of my mouth. I needed ramen.    Going by the name alone, I ventured over to Sanuki Rock. Sanuki is the old name for the part of Japan. Again, most people know Sanuki udon. But Sanuki ramen? Rock and roll Sanuki ramen?    Wow! I throw the word kodawari around a lot, as a term to describe the special attention to detail that goes into really excellent food. This one is very kodawari. Wonderful noodles and pork, but the highlight was that soup. Made with soy sauce from nearby Shodoshima Island, it's a deep, dark celebration of local flavors.  The perfect bowl after a night of drinking or eating oily chicken!    I asked the master what the deal with the name was. Easy to remember was the plan. People have no problem saying, \"Let's go to rock!\"  ロック行きましょう！      香川県高松市常磐町2-1-1 Kagawa-ken, Takamatsu-shi, Tokiwacho 2-1-1 Closest station: Takamatsu  Open 11:30-14:00, 18:00-1:00am Closed on most Sundays      ",

As Yamagata is the master's home prefecture, much of the menu hails from there.    The Yamagata rice was particularly nice. Watch the video to see what I mean.

        "post": " 西尾中華そば    Nishio Chukasoba was one of my all-time favorite shops in Japan. Old-school mixed with the new. Classic chukasoba with noodles that had a touch of corn flour in them. One of my regrets in life is that I didn't visit their Komagome shop enough, even though I lived fairly close.  For the record, I probably slurped there a dozen times back in the day. Not enough at all.    Well, Nishio is part of the Nagi group, and he left his shop in the hands of the well-equipped Kabo-chan to pursue overseas ventures. Nagi is killing it in Asia, so I can't fault him. At least he still does the occasional pop-up here in Tokyo.    This one was a one-day event on January 2nd, 2016. His \"leveled-up\" bowl was an exercise in crafting ramen from the best ingredients, sourced from the far reaches of Japan. There is soy sauce from Shodoshima. There is chicken from Aichi, Kumamoto, Aomori, and Iwate. There are organic eggs from Yamanashi. There is, well, read the above Japanese description and you'll see about 50 local ingredients.    For some reason, there was a really nice collection of tequila. 400 yen for a shot? At 11am? Sure!    Hmmm, maybe we shouldn't be drinking tequila first thing in the morning.    The ramen was, as expected, amazing. This is what happens when you go for broke with your ingredients. Complex umami flavors under a deep, meaty broth.    If it looks oily, that's because it is. But that layer of chicken oil, called chiyu in Japanese, is a delicacy unto itself. A byproduct of making the stock, it is one of the hardest things for ramen shops to get right. Too heavy, and it coats your mouth with fat. Too thin, and the bowl lacks substance. Nishio's chiyu has always been perfect.    Great stuff. I hope he makes it back to Japan more often.        ",

Sure, I have stellar slurps all the time, but it takes more, like a funky atmosphere or interesting sides to make me look twice.    Donryu had both. This Kyushu-style shop is covered, ceiling to floor, with graffiti that just happens to be the menu.    Go ahead and get a bottle of shochu and some sides before you even think about ramen.    I drink mine on the rocks. A side of beef tendon stew is the perfect match. The only thing better would be . . .    . . . fresh mentaiko. I was told that this mentaiko, from Fukuya, is some of the best in Japan.    The ramen is above average, and Kyushu to the core. A bit less stinky than other shops of this nature, but still full of flavor and a kind of meaty-creamy-umami that you can only get from boiling pork bones for many, many hours.    Kaedama, an extra serving of noodle, is a must.  I made a video with #TokyoExtra here. The show always has an added way to make the meal better, dubbed Brian's Extra. Well, I suggested Donryu for their mentaiko extra. When we showed up to shoot, they were out.

Though ramen adventures is weighted towards the smaller ramen shops in Japan, I feel it is my duty to tell which chains make the cut.    Kamukura's soup is quite deep, and fits to a T with the surrounding area. A little saltier, a little more in-your-face, this bowl is my kind of post-drinking ramen.    But enough about their ramen. The main reason I stepped in this day was to try their karaage, fried chicken. If you've spent any time in Japan, you'll know how popular boneless fried chicken is. As a street food at festivals, paired with a beer at an izakaya, or in this case, alongside ramen.    Kamukura's fried chicken recently won a gold medal from the Nippon Karaage Kyokai. Yes, there is an official organization for fried chicken in Japan. And, yes, they hold annual competitions to find the best of the best.    Specifically, these babies won a gold in the Central Japan Shoyu Seasoning category for their fried chicken rice bowl.    So how are they?    Well, their regular fried chicken goes great with a brew.    And the award winning rice bowl is solid by itself. I was a little surprised that it is only 390 yen. If you aren't in the mood for a whole meal, this has quick snack written all over it.      Crushed it!    Crushed it!

They were one of the contenders at a tsukemen festival, and my ramen buddy Abram and I were at the height of our tenure with Weekly Playboy magazine. Out Ramem Americans column helped land us a a few gigs, and this was one.    Otodo went on to win a silver prize at that festival, if memory serves me. They've gone on after that to win more and more, and not just for ramen. They won prizes at a rice bowl festival and a gyoza festival to name a few.    Well, I'm back at a different branch of Otodo, this one named Otodo Shokudo. The shokudo in the name means it is more than just ramen. In fact, the menu is so big that only a digital ticket machine would do.    Noodles dishes, rice dishes, and sides. As this is Kasai, out towards rural Chiba, a shop owner can have a bigger shop and not have to worry so much about the bottom line.  Well, as this was a TV shooting, I completely forgot to take my regular photos of the ramen (link to the video is down below). I can say that it is the typical gatsuri style that Otodo is known for. Heavy on the garlic, with a triple meat soup. Chicken, pork, and beef come together not in a refined elegant way, but in an in-your-face meat explosion. Good stuff, though unless you live out in the sticks, head to the Koenji shop for convenience.    As I was checking the accolades, I notices that they had won a gold ribbon for their gyoza. I'm a fan of Japanese-style pot stickers, but I'm rarely blown away. They are either good or bad, and I've never had dumplings that I could really rave about.    Until I had these. Yes, these gyoza are noticeably better than any I've ever had. Rich and juicy, they didn't even need any of the usual soy sauce or vinegar.  The secret? The filling is enhanced with seabura, pork back fat. When they cook, the fat melts, but stays inside. You can probably imagine how they taste.    Check the video!

Soup and noodles, and nothing else, is the recommended bowl.    My visit to the Akabane store was for a TV shooting, some show that aired at 4:30am on a Tuesday. A show that was seen by no one. I can usually tell if a TV show is popular by the jump in hits to this site. Tuesday morning had no visible spike.    Years later, and Ito has a few more shops around Tokyo. Today's visit to the Ito in Ginza was also for a TV taping. And . . . action!    Niboshi, dried baby sardine, is an amazing ingredient, and niboshi ramen should be tried by everyone at least once. Some people are put off by the bitter, smoky flavor, but the majority of folks fall in love at first slurp. Ito is one of the best, and though the shop has expanded into a bit of a mini-chain, they still keep the quality top-notch.  Very convenient location in the heart of Ginza.

Should I write more? Should I write in detail about the use of clams to increase the level of umami? Should I discuss the Aomori chicken that is some of the most tender I've tasted?

Omiya is a major transit point, and business is booming.    In case you can't decipher all that Japanese on the storefront, I'll explain. This shop is using an automated iPad ordering system, and delivering your ramen via an air cushion.    I think my explanation makes perfect sense, but I'll break it down.    Get a QR code when you order.    Snap a shot.    Take some selphies.    Wait for the air-cushion-ramen-retrieval system to activate.    And here it is!  Kind of silly, kind of pointless. There were enough staff on hand to make this system unnecessary, but where is the fun in that?  The ramen is typical Nagi. You can get the niboshi or the tonkotsu.

The success of this event led others to delve into the field, and I remember the early days of the Grand Tsukemen Fest back in 2009. The concept is always the same; buy tickets, wait in lines, eat ramen.    These events often change vendors on a weekly basis. This event, in Machida, had 10 shops that changed every week for four weeks. So, if you were so inclined, you could crush 40 bowls from all over Japan.    In fact, many of the Japanese ramen bloggers I know do just that. They come to every festival, make trips across the country, and slurp everything they can.    I rolled into this, the 2nd week of the festival, with three other ramen nuts; a ramen-loving custom motorcycle maker, a ramen-loving gravure idol, and a ramen-loving exotic car collector. Ten bowls was no problem.    Apologies for not really reviewing the bowls. You can check out more info over at the event's site:  http://dai-tsukemen-haku.com/    Basically, going to these events alone is tough. Even if you are at comptetive-eater level, you still have to wait for each shop. A small group can come up with a battle strategy to crush them all.    So many bowls!    So much ramen!    If you want to know about these festivals, the Ramen Databank has a page (in Japanese) informing you about upcoming events. Check it here:  http://ramendb.supleks.jp/events    Thanks for the ride!

The fates aligned, as there was a very popular, very remote ramen shop along my intended route, and they open at 10.    This shop is a trip. It's run by three old ladies, and the customers reflect the staff. At 38, I'm no spring chicken, but I must have been half the age of the seven or eight people waiting outside the shop.    This is the chashumen. I usually don't get a massive bowl the first time around, but that visual is quite striking. Most customers had theirs topped with a mound of raw local onion.    It's a decent bowl, but not the kind I would go telling people to make a journey for. And, unfortunately, you'll need to make a journey if you want to experience this one. It's over three hours by train from central Tokyo, though travel time is just about an hour if you drive without traffic.  The soup was very dark and very salty. The pork was also very heavily seasoned, the kind I really enjoy for a couple pieces, but can't handle more.  It is the atmosphere that is the appeal here. Such an old shop, with such character. It's no surprise that this shop has been on TV many times.      千葉県富津市竹岡401 Chiba-ken, Futsu-shi, Takeoka 401 Closest station: Takeoka  Open 10:00-19:00 Closed Tuesdays and some Mondays      ",

Sure, this is located in the middle of Asakusa, one of Tokyo's most touristy neighborhoods, but that number seems crazy for a country of, well, Japanese people.    The master explained it perfectly.    The shop is Halal certified, and a bit of a destination for Muslims wanting to try something Japanese. Dietary restrictions can be a nightmare in Japan, and a shop like this is an oasis.    The ramen wasn't really to my liking, I found it too garlicky, with herbs and vegetables being used to replace the non-halal meats and alcohol that gives ramen a lot of its signature umami flavors.  But if you are strict halal, your ramen options are either this place, or my recommendation of Oka.

The St. Germain neighborhood is posh and trendy, and it is good to see them with a couple great ramen shops.    Ippudo is Ippudo. Either you love it and obsess, or you just enjoy it as a normal bowl. Me, I slurp at my local Ippudo on occasion, and am always satisfied. They've been pushing the ramen-envelope quite a bit lately, with their global expanse showing no ends. With the recent news that they teamed up with Panda Express, get ready for Ippudo to be all over the place in America in the near future.    While their US business is set to explode, the European side of things has taken some time. Ippudo had planned a Parisian ramen dining restaurant akin to their New York branch some time ago, but the delays have been non-stop. Construction problems, tenant issues, supply problems, it has been so long that they decided to go ahead and open a second shop, before the first could start serving.  This shop is smaller, and the menu is mostly just ramen. My kind of shop!    Well, the standard akamaru is just how I remember it. No review needed.  The master here is none other than Conner Callahan, whom I met at Ippudo's ramen competition last year. He insisted that I try their vegetarian bowl. Two bowls in a row, no problem.    Gasp. Whoah. OMG.  This is, in all honesty, the best vegetarian bowl of ramen I've ever had. The soup is a blend of a Japanese kelp and mushroom dashi and a French vegetable bouillon. The combination is so full of umami. I was shocked at this bowl.  The noodles are made like those at Soranoiro in Tokyo, with paprika giving them a bright orange hue.  The toppings; fried mushrooms and a dollop of ratatouille.    This recipe was developed by the head chef of their New York branch.  Out of a dozen or so shops in Tokyo doing a vegetarian bowl, I can only recommend two. Ippudo's Paris branch would make that three. Any chances of Ippudo opening a branch of their French shop in Japan?    Good luck Ippudo, though you don't really need it.

        "post": " 拘りラーメン      I sat down almost a year ago in Tokyo with JB, the owner of newly opened Parisian ramen shop Kodawari Ramen. He had dreams of bringing a real bowl to France, the kind that he slurped every time he visited Japan. Not just the taste, but the atmosphere, the feeling, of Japanese ramen.    That was how Kodawari Ramen was born.    The shop is an absolute trip. Located in trendy St. Germain, stepping in is like being transported back to Japan, into a dingy alleyway of a real Yokocho, one of Japan's tightly packed food streets. Check out my YouTube video for a walkgthrough. It is safe to say that this is a must-visit shop just for the traditional chochin lanterns, rickety sheet metal roof awnings, and ripped-from-the-pavement (literally) Tokyo manhole covers on the floor.      Then there is the ramen. While the global trend is still heavy on the pork, Japan is all about chicken these days. High-quality, healthy, farm-raised poultry is the norm at the best ramen shops in Tokyo, and Kodawari isn't any different.    Embracing chicken, Kodawari ramen's small menu has only four bowls of soup; a shoyu, a shio, a paitan, and one made with black sesame.    As expected, the black sesame is the most popular. People outside of Japan still tend to gravitate to less-simple ramen, and this is proof. An excellent bowl, but I would suggest starting with the shoyu ramen your first time. Kodawari is importing high quality soy sauce from Japan, and you might be surprised how good it is.    There are two soupless bowls on the menu, with one of them being the vegetarian option for the shop. These bowls really let the noodles shine. Want to know more about the noodles? I am going to write in detail about this later, but for a quick summary, Kodawari Ramen is growing their own wheat and having it milled by an artisinal miller. I've never seen anyone go this deep into noodles, even in Japan. Of course, they are making the noodles in house as well. Amazing.    The shio bowl has a lot of ramen nerds debating if it is okay to put a tomato in your ramen. Of course, I say it is fine, tomatoes have a lot of natural umami, and shio needs that extra kick, but many self-proclaimed ramen experts in Paris have said it is unacceptable.    My favorite bowl is the toripaitan. It has that extra umami that I love. Not as creamy as some toripaitan bowls I've had, but more robust and intense.    The egg, though not as bright orange as the premium ones we get in Japan, is on point.    Kodawari Ramen is poised to be an important player in the French ramen scene. Ramen in Paris is abysmal at best, with most shops being a combination of Chinese, Japanese, and Thai under one roof. Anywhere that serves sushi and ramen is already doing something wrong (not always the case), but when you start throwing in random Asian cuisine, you've gone too far. I saw dozens of these shops around Paris.  I'm not here to tell you what to eat, but when you visit restaurants created by people who truly care about the food, you're not only helping yourself, but helping to create a vibrant restaurant scene. Kodawari Ramen, alongside anyone else who opens a legit ramen shop in Paris, is a big step in the right direction.

The most recent was down in Kumamoto, in the southern island of Kyuushu. The 2016 series of earthquakes, which included a magnitude 7.0, have directly affected around 44,000 people in the area.    Charity drives are common in Japan, and ramen shops love to get in on the help. On a warm Saturday back in May, Kuijirashokudo teamed up with a few other spots to do a limited bowl to raise funds for Kumamoto.    Regardless of how good the bowl is, hats off to these guys.    Well, the bowl was pretty amazing. Noodles from Antai Noodles, a shop that is on my hit-list. The soup was rich shoyu.    They made a katsuo jelly that was injected into the egg for maximum umami. Topped with thick roast pork chashu.    Original review of Kujira Shokudo here.  ",

Today's shooting took us out to trendy Sangenjaya, a suburb just west of Shibuya.    This was one of the last shows we filmed. Thank you everyone who supported #TokyoExtra for nearly 40 episodes.    Fujishiro has praise from all the magazines. The chef trained at Honda, one of Tokyo's most famous ramen shops.    Tori paitan, creamy chicken soup, that is enhanced with fried beef sinew. It's a bit more rustic than your average chicken-only soup.    The aromatic drizzle of oil on top gives it a boost. Most shops with this style of creamy ramen know that a little fried garlic and onion go a long way.    Sangenjaya isn't far from Shibuya, so if you live or are staying in the area, this is a good choice for a quick bowl.      東京都世田谷区三軒茶屋1-37-1 Tokyo, Setagaya-ku, Sangenjaya 1-37-1 Closest station: Sangenjaya  Open 11:00-15:00, 18:00-22:00 Closed Tuesdays      ",

        "post": " 拘りラーメンの麺    Kodawari Ramen, the latest authentic ramen shop to hit Paris, has a trick up their sleeve. A trick that deserves an entire conversation of its own.  Let's take a look at Kodawari's noodles.    Of course, they are homemade. Kodawari managed to get a sleek new Yamato noodle machine for this purpose.    The basement of the shop has been turned into a hermetically sealed flour-only zone. The smell of nothing but flour and noodles is so amazing. I really wish regular customers could have a chance to take a peek.    In Japan, great flour for making great noodles is no problem. Japanese flour used to make ramen noodles tends to be higher in protein, and is often milled to a finer consistency than typical bread flours. If you've ever had an amazing noodle, you know that it is chewy and firm, and holds together in a bowl of hot soup.  Try putting a nice baguette into some hot soup. Most will fall apart in less than a minute. Part of that is due to the flour.  Kodawari needed to get their hands on some special flour.    No one in France was making specialty flour for Chinese noodles. Other shops are either importing flour or making due with the local stuff. Enter Gilles Matignon. Located in Château-Landon, about 100km south of Paris, his artisanal milling factory has been making small batches of flour for many, many years.    Gilles himself is a fourth generation miller, though the area's wheat history goes back much farther than that.    Still sitting on the old bedrock, the flour is produced in a beautiful old building. Walking around inside is both inspiring and terrifying. Everything is moving, shaking, grinding. I'm shocked by how clean it is; only finding one lone spiderweb (covered in flour) outside the never-used side door.   (image from http://fourapain710.blogspot.jp/)    Gilles gave us a quick tour. Though the region is famous for their stone grinding history, the new machines are much more efficient.    Wheat is ground by multiple machines, sent down the tubes, and collected at the bottom.    I relied on JB, the owner at Kodawari Ramen to pick up the details, as my French is quite abysmal, and the whine of the machinery would have made any language hard to understand.    JB had actually approached a number of millers with his idea, and they all turned him down. To make this special flour, the miller would have to retrofit his gear with some new systems. Not much, but an ordeal none-the-less. Gilles was the only one who took up the challenge.    Here's JB with the ramen-flour-only tubes.    I had a chat with Gilles about his philosophy. He has grown up with flour, and has witnessed the rise of GMO crops and the decline of the natural ways. Modern crops contain much less nutrients, which is a huge problem in something as precise as noodles or bread. Flavor and health has given way to empty calories and high volume. He is sticking to his roots, and that is a good thing.    We made a video as well:         ",

        "post": " 人  Sightseeing and food are important parts of travel, but truly memorable experiences are always enhanced by the people you meet. People of Qinghai have had little contact with Westerners, and your presence brings out their smiles and curiosity. Locals would snap shots on the sly, and when we would approach them to reciprocate, no one had a problem. Here are some of my favorite shots from the trip, with a bit of ramen thrown in.    The monk with a $3000 camera and a Rolex.    The old guy just flying a kite.    Our group was always getting asked for photos. Since we are all bloggers and YouTubers, no problem! Here Abigail from Smiling Seoul takes her hundredth photo of the day. Check out here channel for an interesting view on living in Korea.    The dinner singers. We kept chanting for one more. After about five encores they ran away.    The hat salesman.    The Tibetans. You are meant to bow 100,000 times. They each have a counter on their finger (or an app on their phone) to keep track. Takes a few months for someone in good shape.    The staff at a Mongolian-themed show.    Candy getting her slurp on. Candy is the girl behind On The List Melbourne. Check it out if you are in Melbourne and want to know everything that is going on!    Dane from The Healthy Tradie knows that even an uber-healthy diet can include some carbs from ramen.    This was my favorite ramen of the trip. On the corner of Wusi and Jianyan in Xining if you are ever out there.    Simple, Lanzhou-style beef noodle soup. I'm not sure if it is standard, but they brought out some plates of snacks; veggies and tofu flavored with spice, garlic, and vinegar.    Others on the trip that I haven't mentioned are Maria from The Art of Plating, Jasmine from My Berlin Fashion, and Megan from Mapping Megan.    The chess players.      The grandpa and child. Baby was really fascinated with my camera, so I let him press the shutter.    Baby's first shot!    The drone pilot.    Drone = instant popularity. Take note.    The curious toddler.    The curious young men. They were fascinated how we were documenting our trip.    The mullet dude. Business in the front, party in the back.    The Scott Gomez jersey dude.    The dancer.    The DJ.    The unknowing Abbey Road walkers.    The munchkins.    The fashionable one out.    The goofy performer.    I always search for the most hipster cafe in whatever town I am visiting. This time I was lucky enough to be joined by Chris John Millington, one of the guys responsible for epic beards becoming a fashion trend. Check his website, Forget Fashion.    Thanks for posing!    The barista. His cafe, which I can't find on the map, was on Switzerland Street in Qilian.    The future bad-ass.  And then, just when I had forgotten why I came, this lady came strolling by, with bags full of noodles.    Sure, thousands of years have done a lot for noodles, and I still think Japanese ramen is where my heart slurps, but seeing how ingrained noodle culture is in culture here is amazing.  Although I can't recommend any exact shops, I can give a solid tip. Look for the ? shop with a crowd, and slurp where slurping all began.    ",

        "post": " かすい    When I travel for work, I don't subject my colleagues to my ramen adventures. I tend to go out late, slurp multiple bowls, and try my best to be low-key. Those I work with, for the most part, take a bit of arm-pulling to even leave the cheap business hotels we stay in. Check in, watch a 500 yen pay-per-view movie, and sleep. I think it is a huge waste, travelling to the far reaches of Japan on weekends, then sitting in a sterile hotel room, but I can also see it as a way to recharge after the week in Tokyo.    Well, I dragged them out in Asahikawa. Not for ramen, but to a friend of a friend's izakaya, located in the heart of Asahikawa's red-light district. Nestled in with 40 other shops, from snack bars to quite restaurants, Tokiyasu was awesome and I'm glad I forced the social evening.    And though I ate my fill of raw Hokkaido salmon, seasoned deep-fried chicken, and corn tempura, I said goodnight to the crew and went for a bowl.    My biggest problem with non-Tokyo Japan, especially somewhere like Asahikawa, is that the ramen shops close early. Eight or nine at night. In a country that views ramen as the perfect post-drinking food, I just don't understand.    But there are always a few. Kasui is open late, three or four in the morning late.    And it ain't bad. Typical Asahikawa style; heavy, porky broth with a lot of heavy, dark soy sauce. Great for preventing a hangover the next day, just make sure you drink a lot of water with that soup.    And though it isn't Hachiya, Kasui gets the job done.             北海道旭川市3条通7 ソシアルビル 1F Hokkaido, Asahikawa-shi, 3-7 Closest station: Asahikawa  Open 11:30-15:00, 17:30-3:00am Weekends until 4:00am        ",

        "post": " レストラン ラ フィネス    What the?!?! Is that ramen?  You bet!  La FinS is an upscale French restaurant specializing in the harmony of both local and exotic ingredients. Chef Keizo Sugimoto has spent his life cooking, studying in both Japan and France before opening La FinS.  So why the ramen? Well, it's offered as an addition to the regular course menu. And just like the cuisine here, you never really know what you'll get.    Here, roast pigeon breast is topped with copious amounts of black truffle. The glass keeps the intense aroma from escaping.    Finished with a cream sauce to make Sugimoto's own distant relative version of Carbonara pasta.    And then, as if this weren't enough, a side of quail and bear meat confit.  The noodles come from a nearby noodle maker, but the dish is pure FinS.    Next is the cold ramen. One of the first things that strikes you is the bowl. La FinS has impeccable dinner wear; handmade plates and dishes from artisinal craftsmen. The bowl for this one, though, is a freshly frozen slice of bamboo trunk. Yes, it was frozen.    Soft-shelled turtle broth with matsutake mushrooms and abalone up top.    Suddenly, Chef Suimoto appeared and dumped sub-freezing sansho pepper into the mix.  Like I said, the ramen can be added in addition to the restaurant's course menu. We talked, Chef and I, about the other ramen in his repertoire. Ise ebi bisque, uni creams, and anything with heavy umami came into the conversation.    Keep this one in mind for those special occasions.  Official site here.        ",

I actually ran into a famous ramen critic by chance the day before, and he clued me into the new shop's opening. Thanks Mr. らおす!    Muginae's m.o. is to follow the awesome trend of using very high quality, very specific ingredients in the bowl. Free range chickens from Yamagata give the broth a solid base, with a tare made from Nagano and Hyogo craft soy sauces.    Noodles are made in house with Japanese flour. Of course, the entire bowl is devoid of any chemical seasoning.    It all adds up to a stellar bowl on Tokyo's south side. Go for the deluxe bowl (the most expensive of the three) and get all the fixings.    An oft overlooked aspect of ramen shops are their bowls. Here, the bowls are handmade by a local artisan. Very cool to have some handmade pottery holding my noodles.    They also have a limited-to-a handful-a-day rice bowl topped with fresh fish from the neighborhood fish monger. I'm loving the dedication to the block.    I just hope the location doesn't hurt their business. The Yamanote line is the most convenient line in Tokyo, but I can't imagine what you could do in Omori.

Most people wouldn't give Mito a second thought, but having been here a few times, I can vouch for it as a nice place. The most known part of Mito, and the place that 99% of Tokyoites come here for is the famous garden, which is full of blooming ume plum trees sometime in February or March. The city even opens a special train station for the express train, so you don't need to set foot anywhere besides Kairakuen Garden.  But like I said, Mito is nice. I spent a few days here many, many years ago, hanging out on the banks of their lake, watching the swans (Mito has a large number if black swans), and relaxing.    Like any town in Japan, Mito has a few famous ramen shops. Mujaki draws a line, so try and get there early.    The mujakisoba, a thick chicken soup, is the one to go with. Check the pink row on the ticket machine.    The also offer any menu item with shrimp flavoring, something I'll try if I ever make it back.    Homemade noodles, of course.  Mujaki was tasty, though the 30 minute walk from the station, in the opposite direction of anything Mito has to offer was a bit far. Sure enough, most patrons drive.      茨城県水戸市東台1-5-31 Ibaraki-ken, Mito-shi, Higashidai 1-5-31 Closest station: Mito  Open 11:30-14:30. 18:00-21:00 Closed Wednesdays      ",

I was lucky enough to make it to the limited Marvel x Ippudo collaboration event with the relase of Captain America: Civil War. What does a six item, limited menu look like? How do you represent each side and all of their allies at a ramen shop?    First, go download the Marvel version of Tsum Tsum. Do they have this smartphone game overseas? Board any crowded train in Japan, look over your neighbor's shoulder, and I give it a fifty fifty chance they are playing this game. (Editor's note, I wrote this before Pokemon Go was a thing).  I know this is sounding like a sponsored post, but it isn't. I wish this site was sponsored by Disney.    Let the feast begin!    A refreshing blue beverage (Captain) and some spicy fried noodles (Stark). I'm not a fan of sweet drinks, so the clear victor was Team Stark with their tasty snack. On to the ramen!    Each ingredient in the bowl is meant to parallel a character in the movie. Breaking it down:  Pepper studded noodles, a.k.a. Ant-麺. A fried chicken wing, from Falcon. A Bucky bomb eggplant. Bacon espuma. I was told this is a missile bubble. Not sure. Scarlet Witch red magic tomato. And of course the A for America.   This bowl was awesome. A very light chintan soup, with very firm, peppery noodles. The bacon espuma should make its way into more light bowls of ramen. Who doesn't love bacon!     Over at Team Iron, a.k.a. Team Paitain:   Black Widow noodles, made with carrots for a red color. Spiderman webbing, which was actually cotton candy. Tony's arc reactor egg. A mix of Vision veggies. Black Panther's balsamic vinegar sauce. War Machine's meatball.   I wasn't feeling this one at all! Actually, and I told this to the staff, the two corn chips made the whole bowl smell like, well, corn chips. I removed them and proceeded, but this bowl was just crazy. Definitely a win for Team Captain.     After the bowls, a snack and desert.    The parma ham sushi bites were meant to be little Tsum Tsums (is that even a word) from the game. Tasty!  Desert was a Captain America pudding.    Tickets for this event were gone within four hours of it being announced on their Facebook page. You can check it out here so you never miss another event!

But the entire fish market was randomly closed that day.    Fortunately, the shops along the outer market are open for business, and business is booming. Wakaba has been around for over 60 years, and their no-nonsense bowl is a hit with both local fishermen and not-so-local tourists. On this day, when the fishermen were off, the line was about 10 deep with overseas customers.    Ramen, ramen with wonton, ramen with extra pork. It's a simple menu for a simple bowl.    Not the kind of ramen I go for, but the atmosphere of standing and slurping in the crowded market is fun, especially if you are on vacation. I'm curious how this will all feel in a few in a few short months, when the market moves further from the city center.

The Hakodate-only chain of Lucky Pierrot burger shops are quite popular. As for ramen, Hakodate is all shio. All salt.    Actually, I don't understand Hakodate's claim to shio fame. Sure, there are a handful of shops, but how can a handful of clear, salt ramen bowls entice an entire nation to call Hakodate the salt ramen capitol of Japan. On a recent ramen quiz show, I was told that over 70% of Japanese people surveyed knew this about Hakodate.  Is this the same phenomenon that occurs in my hometown of San Francisco? A place where authentic clam chowder is served at all the finest tourist traps in the city? More research is needed!    My research took me here, to the most popular mom-and-pop ramen shop in Hakodate. Seiryuken (lit. star dragon house) opens for a long lunch service, and runs out of soup on a regular basis. I've worked in the area about five or six times, and had been greeted with a urikire, sold out, five or six times.  This time, I showed up 30 minutes before they opened.    The hype was strong. The hype is well deserved.  Good shio ramen takes a basic chicken broth and hits it with an umami overload. The first sip is mom's chicken soup, with an aftertaste of refined Japanese flavors. It goes from intense to subtle in a heartbeat, a rhythm broken up only by the sparse toppings.    I'm sold. Hakodate equals shio.  Seiryuken boasts a huge menu of noodle and rice dishes, from katsudon to kareraisu to zangi. Pork bowl to curry to fried chicken. The shio is a must, but if you go with a group you could probably split a few more dishes.

And with direct flights from Shanghai, Seoul, and Bangkok, visiting the cool-in-summer northern island is a breeze.    Waiting in line for famous shops isn't just a Japanese obsession. A few shops I visited this time, both ramen and not, were about two thirds overseas tourists.    The one thing I don't understand, though, is why you would go out of your way to visit the chains. Baikoken isn't a huge chain, but it has certainly evolved into the chain category. With nine shops in Japan and eight overseas, they are bringing the Asahikawa ramen game to the world.    Not a bad bowl, and certainly better than their outlet in Tokyo. I'm sure the guidebooks are rich with suggestions for places like this.    The fact of the matter is that I was spoiled by Hachiya, what I consider one of the best bowls in the country. I didn't take any shots, but I slurped there a few hours before Baikoken, and kind of ruined my palate with the ultra rich, in-your-face impact that you only find at that shop.  Anyways, Baikoken is a famous place, and if you are going to hit it up, you might as well do it at the main shop in Asahikawa.

Shops I wanted to visit were closed, the weather was completely random, and bowls that I did manage to slurp weren't all that great. Had I eaten at every good ramen shop in Hokkaido?    A few years back I was hitchhiking in this part of Japan, and an Asahikawa local said i should try ホルメン, ramen topped with horumon, animal innards. Not something I normally go for, but if it is a local ramen dish that a local said you gotta try, you gotta try.  It was also a chance to check out the Asahikawa Ramen Village, a collection of eight shops on the outskirts of town. The funny thing is, this place is very inconveniently located, and most of these places have their head shop within walking distance of Asahikawa Station.    You've got Aoba.    Ittetsu-an Matsuda.    Ishida.    Tenkin.    Baikoken.    Kobo Kato.    Saijo.    Santoka.    Well, if you like sweetened pig butt fried as a topping, you might enjoy Saijo. Me, I can't stand the stuff. It looks like quite a few shops in the area do limited bowls of intestine-topped ramen. It is supposed to give guys stamina.  I'll gladly throw up (no pun intended) a guest post by someone who can crush all eight of the participating shop's horumen bowls. As for me, I'm out!

The campground on lake Kanayama is beautiful, and I should have just set up my tent, cracked a bottle of local sake, and been done with the day. But no, there was a cheese factory, of all the stupid things to be interested in, about 50 kilometers away. I had a bottle of French wine, a Premier Cru made by a friend of mine, that I had lugged in my bike's touring cases, and I was set to drink it with something nice.  Halfway to the cheese factory, a thunderstorm. The mountains were cold, I didn't have my rain gear, but I continued on. Of course, you can guess what happened. The cheese factory was closed for the day when I arrived. Of course.    So on my way back to the campground, I stopped at the only ramen shop I could see.    Obihiro is the largest town in the area (I considered going there to get a hotel room instead of camping), and Rocky is a group of three or four shops in the area. Serviceable miso ramen for local families and truck drivers, but nothing I would return for.    I spent the night cold and wet, and discovered that my prized camping tent has a leak.  But wait, there's more to the story. The next day, on the way to a dry hotel room in Asahikawa, I found another cheese factory, where I purchased a nice aged cheddar and a smoked Camembert. A day later, at the top of a 2300 meter mountain peak, I popped the cork on that wine. Of course, you can guess what happened. I had left the cheese in the hotel room's fridge.      北海道上川郡新得町字新得基線118 Hokkaido, Kamigawa-gun, Shintokucho, Shintokukisen 118 Closest station; Shintoku  Open 11:00-19:00 Closed Thursdays          ",

Here I am, one of two contestants still standing at round 15. To my left is Brendan, an expert on Japanese castles. Dude knew his stuff.    I managed to get it right, question 15 and 16, something about obscure ramen ingredients if I remember. Then came question 17.    What tool does Enjin use to make their broth smooth? Any idea?    Well, I missed it, thinking it was probably some kind of blender used to aerate the soup. It was my second strike (I missed a question about a particular branch of Nagi and which exit of Shibuya Station is was closest to), and the victory went to the castle nerd. C'est la vie. Shoganai.    If you've been, you will know the answer immediately.    They hit their soup with an industrial blow torch. Creamy lard is roasted in the high heat, and the entire bowl benefits from it.    They have two versions, a 2012 and a 2011, with the newer one being the most popular.  And, yeah, it lives up to the hype. The soup is smooth, smooth, smooth. Easily in my top 10 for Sapporo bowls, though you can probably tell by my failure to pull off the win that I don't know much about Hokkaido's capital city.  Thanks to everyone who watched!

The year was 1998, in a decade where ramen was really taking the country by storm. This new thing called the Internet was informing the masses, and regional ramen was becoming a hot topic among foodies.  As always, more conventional media was slow to catch on, but catch on they did. TV shows about ramen began popping up on occasion, then more frequently, and the general, internet-un-savy populace wanted more. So much so, in fact, that the mega popular show TV Champion focused their 1998 airing on the topic of finding the best ramen in the country. Now, I've lived in Japan for over ten years now, and I still can't understand the madness that is year-end TV. From the last days of December until the second or third of January, families reconvene at their jika, hometown, and do nothing more than sit around, eat, drink, and watch variety TV shows.    So when Ideshoten was named the best ramen in the country on national TV, millions upon millions watched.  Nearly 20 years later, and the shop is still on every ramen lover's list. If Wakayama weren't so darn far from everything else, I would be sending people here without hesitation.    We'll get to the ramen in a sec. On the simple menu is すし - sushi - for 150 yen. This is an important part of Wakayama ramen, the hayazushi - fast sushi.    It's sitting on the counter, ready to eat. Just grab one and dig in!    Simple, pressed, vinegared mackerel sushi. Super satisfying after the the wait in line. I didn't try, but you might be able to grab some while you wait; Ideshoten has been known to have some serious lines on busy days.    The ramen is a thick tonkotsu-shoyu. Porky soup with a strong soy sauce flavor. Thin noodles and your standard toppings round out the bowl. It's simple, but you can imagine the ramen judges of two decades ago being entranced by this local creation. Feel-good ramen that encapsulates the idea of shokunin, someone who devotes their life to a single dish.  Personally, I find Wakayama ramen to have a grittier taste and texture than other bowls that use similar ingredients. I also think this is the most underrated style in the country, and a great bowl of Wakayama ramen is something I constantly crave.    An amazing bowl, and if you want to continue your Wakayama search, check out the city's ramen map here.      和歌山県和歌山市田中町4-84 Wakayama, Wakayama-shi, Tanakacho 4-84 Closest station: Wakayama  Open 11:30-11:30 Closed Thursdays  ",

While Tokyo is all over the place in terms of variety of cuisine, Osaka's cuisine is all over the place in terms of variety. Does that make any sense?    Jikon (or is it Zikon?) isn't far from central Osaka, but it feels like you are in another prefecture. Very rural, with plenty of salarymen riding the early evening train back to their families.    About a 30 minute train, followed by a long walk to the shop.    At the shop's opening time, I was second in line. The gentleman before me didn't even have to order, he was a regular who always gets two bowls. One of the shop's famous 芳醇醤油鶏そば, mellow shoyu chicken soba, and one of something a bit more intense. And while the menu has that typical Osaka variety thing going, I had to stick with the classic on my first time.    If you nerd out about deep umami flavors, this bowl is up there. The master uses konbu from Raosu and Rishiri islands in Hokkaido, considered the best in Japan. If you are ever lucky enough to visit that part of the country, you'll see small-scale mom-and-pop kelp operations, where pristine pieces are hand dried by hand and delicately wrapped up to be shipped to the finest restaurants. With that as the base, he flavors this bowl with a special tare reasoning made from ayu fish sauce and natural, unprocessed shoyu.  Toppings include the standards, plus a chicken meatball, plus smoked duck breast.    I think I paid an extra 100 yen for the egg. Amazing value here.  I finished my bowl and watched my neighbor be handed his second. A niboshi ramen taken straight from Ibuki, the famous Tokyo-based niboshi ramen joint. A place I had plans to go to the following week.

They were credited with being one of the shops to put mukacho, preservative-free ramen, on the map. Their kitakata-style noodles were made in house and hand massaged before serving them in a niboshi-rich broth. If you've had real kitakata-style ramen before, you would approve of Shichisai's attention to detail.    So how does their second shop, located in Hatchobori on Tokyo's east side make it even better?    They literally make their noodles on the spot.    From rolling the dough, to kneading it, to cutting it, everything is done in front of you.    And it isn't just a gimmick. The vigorous handling means a chewier noodle.    The only downside is the time. It takes around ten minutes for your noodles to be made. I arrived first thing in the morning on a weekday, so no problem. If you were coming during a busy weekend day you might have to wait a very long time. I can't say for sure, please make sure you arrive early if possible.    Schichisai's broth is deep and smoky. Kitakata-style flavors the broth with dried baby sardines and a lighter style of soy sauce. Heavy enough for a huge impact of flavors, but light enough to crush the entire bowl.

With a few hours layover in Shanghai, I had enough time to meet Michael (site here) for a bowl. Sure, Shanghai has a great number of Japanese ramen shops, but what is something I can't find back home? Shanghai-style noodles?    Not really. This shop is actually Taiwan-style beef noodles. Not that I'm complaining. Shanghai is more known for their dumplings, so I'm happy to slurp at this popular shop.    Very clean, modern, and chic. Yes, this is a shop in one of the city's many new shopping complexes. Yes, I usually avoid this sort of thing. But in an unknown city, with a likely chance of getting lost on the way to a hidden hole-in-the-wall, the fancy department store next to a major station is a good choice.  And now I have a taste for Taiwan, meaning I'll have to make a trip sooner rather than later.    As for these beef noodles, I approve. Solid fare, with a deep, beefy taste to the soup. Very much lacking in the umami department, but that is coming from someone who is invested in that sort of thing.  I would love to hear some of my reader's recommendations for Shanghai. I plan on returning soon for a deeper noodle search.    Site here.    Go to Longyang Road Station Exit 1. It is in the Kerry Parkside shopping mall.  10am-10pm  ",

Actually, with working finishing around 5pm on a Sunday, I could easily change my Shinkansen ticket back to Tokyo to a few hours later, head here for their opening at six, and still make it home before bedtime. For other's I work with, this would be a nightmare; performing for eight hours, then waiting in lines for noodles before the long train back. But if you've followed me recently, you'll know I am obsessed with this list, a 50 best of Japan, and Uemachi comes in at number 30.    A half hour before opening, and there were five people in line. The lure of homemade noodles and a light, preservative-free broth perhaps. I went with the 中華そば, chukasoba, the standard bowl. The other option that looked appealing was the 和え麺, aemen, an all-dashi soup that must be more like a buckwheat soba broth.    Solid.    The master spent four years at another well known Osaka ramen shops (カドヤ食堂). What he learned there was precision, and everything about Uemachi is precise. The soup is a base of very specific chicken from nearby Nara Prefecture and Berkshire Pork from no-so-nearby Kagoshima. It all come together wonderfully. It's the kind of bowl that would give the high-end shoyu ramen shops of Tokyo a run for their money.

While Kamukura has a few shops in and around Tokyo, they are an Osaka institution, and have firmly planted themselves as one of the most important shops in the area. The first shop opened in 1986, and in just 30 years they have gone on to be a huge force in the ramen world. Forty one shops in total.    I took this chance to try and understand their brand a bit more, and maybe find out some secrets that go into the soup.    But, alas, it wasn't going to happen. Kamukura's recipe is a closely guarded secret, and to work here behind the soup you need to pass a series of tests and become a soup sommelier.    Well, what can I discern from the taste alone?    If you've ever been to a nabepa, Japanese nabe hotpot party, then you know. You cook meat and vegetables in a broth, infusing all these great flavors together over the course of an hour or so. You're left with an intense broth, and no nabepa ends without noodles being dumped into the left over soup.  This is a basic description of Kamukura's ramen to me. It's intense, with a lot of meat and cabbage flavors. A bit rough and crazy, but a great bowl.  Kind of like Osaka. To me, Osaka is madness, in the best possible way. After this bowl, I somehow wandered into a random sake bar. Next thing I know, yada yada yada, I was drinking absinthe and eating raw horse in a cyber-goth punk bar with old salarymen. You know, a typical Osaka evening.    I shot a simple video this time around, where I met up with my friend Yuka, an Osaka native. Check it out!

But that word, Michi, simply means road, and there are countless shops with this name. I had, in typical me fashion, not done my research.    No wonder there was no line.    Not a bad shop, but nothing special. Just a normal tsukemen shop. This one was a bit in the Marucho style, a style which I love. But since it is only a few stations from the Meijiro Marucho, I'd say skip it and head there instead.      東京都豊島区池袋3-3-2 Tokyo, Toshima-ku, Ikebukuro 3-3-2 Closest station: Kanamecho  Open 11:00-2:00am    var amzn_wdgt={widget:'Carousel'}; amzn_wdgt.tag='ramenadven-20'; amzn_wdgt.widgetType='Bestsellers'; amzn_wdgt.searchIndex='Grocery'; amzn_wdgt.browseNode='6502934011'; amzn_wdgt.title='Noodles on Amazon'; amzn_wdgt.width='800'; amzn_wdgt.height='200';     ",

With a location just minutes from where I get my hair cut locally (Frank's Chop Shop), I had to go.    I love when Hakata ramen restaurants have a massive side menu.    I especially love when they have mentaiko, spicy cod roe. It is one of the best things in Japan.    Hakata ramen and mentaiko, it's a classic combo.    Shinshin was strictly normal for me. Very group friendly, as you can get a few things on the side of your noodles, drink a few glasses of strong Kyushu shochu, and kick back.

I was officially binging in Osaka ramen before making my way down to Hakata to binge on creamy tonkotsu ramen.    Most shops in Hakata are easy to get to, with long hours and not-so-long waits. Notice I say Hakata, not Fukuoka. There are some shops in the countryside of this prefecture that only open for lunch, run out of soup, and have odd holidays. Thank you Hakata for being tourist friendly.    Isso is a solid shop. Open for 13 hours a day, with no days off makes it convenient as well.    To be honest, this was when I reached my ramen-limit for the week. You've broken me, Hakata!  Which is unfortunate, because Isso serves a fantastic bowl. Opened by the Yamada brothers in 2012, their soup is more on the refined side. They use local fare, the soy sauce, pork, and green onions come from local makers, a sentiment that you feel most shops out here don't adhere to. The soup is constantly moved between pots while cooking, creating what has been dubbed Ramen Cappuccino (their words, not mine).  Great soup, legit noodles, and more toppings than your average tonkotsu bowl. But, like I said, I had just overdosed on ramen.    Adding healthy amount of しょうが - ginger - helped a bit. Ginger is a natural digestive aid, and its use in many Japanese cuisines is a result of a healthful history.    Unsweetened fresh ginger kakigori - Japanese shaved ice. This dish, eaten for breakfast at Suzukake, acted as a much needed cleanse, though I would avoid heavy Kyushu noodles for the next week.

        "post": " 元気一杯    Before you go to Genki Ippai, you need a bit of warning. This shop has some idiosyncrasies that make it stand out. The first is well known; the blue bucket. Genki Ippai has no sign. The only way to find it and know that they are open is to look for the blue bucket outside. Warning number one: if the bucket isn't there, search for your noodles elsewhere. And though they have a set schedule, the master is known for closing if the soup isn't perfect that day.    The next warning: the rules.  No phones No photos Drink some of the soup before eating the noodles Do not put any of the takana, spicy mustard greens, in until you eat a bit of the ramen Don't ask the master about the ramen Don't speculate about the ramen's ingredients    Yep, you might have heard about this one.  Well, the blue bucket was out, so I went in. I was the last customer of the day, and the shop emptied by the time my ramen came. I respect rules, so I didn't talk, didn't shoot photos, and ate the ramen in the prescribed way.  Frankly one of the best Hakata-style tonkotsu bowls I've ever had. I won't speculate about the ingredients, but it was mega porky without much stink. I understand why a few people rank this as their #1.  Then I did something I know I wasn't supposed to do; I asked the master about his ramen.  First I asked if I could take one photo, a photo of the rules, for my site. His response was unexpected. \"Why would you think you couldn't take photos? You're the only person in here!\" Sure enough, I was the only person left, as the blue bucket was no longer outside. Grasping the opportunity, I delved into his thought process. What's with the rules?  To sum it up, he wants everyone to enjoy his ramen to the max of their ability. If someone is talking on their phone, you might be annoyed and it might affect your dining experience. Hearing someone snap shots, and you might worry that your privacy has been invaded. If you are the one taking photos, you are wasting valuable slurping time; thin Hakata noodles are meant to be slurped quickly. Eat some ramen before adding the hot condiment is self explanatory; it was some of the spiciest takana I've ever had.    I don't think you'll be kicked out for breaking the rules, but he does have a sheet with them translated (both English and Chinese). Don't be that guy.  We chatted for about 10 minutes about all things ramen, and he wished me luck on my search. Then, as I was packing away my camera, he runs over to the kitchen and brings out a bag. A tupperware full of the shop's takana, as a gift.  So, yeah, this is officially my favorite place in Hakata.      福岡県福岡市博多区下呉服町4-31 Fukuoka, Fukuoka-shi, Hakata-ku, Shimogofukumachi 4-31 Closest staiton: Gofukumachi  Open 12:00-18:00 Saturdays 12:00-17:00 Closed Sundays  ",

Tonda Station itself isn't so far out, but Kinseimufu, a very highly ranked Osaka shop, is. Almost two miles from the nearest station isn't that bad, but on a cloudless day in the middle of a sweltering Japanese summer, I was about to pay the cash for an air-conditioned cab.  Then we saw it. A few hundred yen for a bicycle rental.    Easy choice. We being myself and Ben from Friends in Ramen, your source for Osaka ramen.    The 燻製鶏塩ラーメン, smoked chicken salt ramen, is the one to get. You still get your excellent shio that the place is known for, but you get the bonus of some amazing smoked meat on top.    I thought the normal shio ramen was quite . . . well . . . normal. Two kinds of chashu, high quality menma, and a light, yet umami-rich soup. Great shio ramen has become commonplace these days, so I can't say if the trek was worth it for the non-ramen-obsessed.    Despite having a mega high rating, the line wasn't bad when they opened.

        "post": " らーめん専門 和心 武庫之荘店    There are actually two shops with the name Nagomi in the eastern part of Hyogo Prefecture, bordering on Osaka. One, the original, is a few blocks off the Hanshin rail line. The other shop, opened by a disciple of the first, is five kilometers north, on the Hankyu line. Both are called Nagomi, though the characters are different (和海 vs 和心).    I bring this up because of a conversation I had with some Osaka natives. When someone moves west of Osaka, the only thing that matters, status-wise at least, is which line they are on. The Hanshin line is by far the lesser of the two, home to old wooden houses, ugly seaside factories, and a general roughness. Hankyu is more manicured beauty, tree-lined sidewalks, and specialty stores.    Sure enough, I arrived at Hanshin Mukogawa Station, where locals were fishing for their dinner in the dirty river. The station itself was a bit dated. Construction workers were taking a break, eating watermelon, atop one of those old wooden houses. And, as if the fates wanted to solidify my opinion of Hanshin, Nagomi was closed that day.    Hankyu Mukonoso Station, on the other hand, is shiny and new. Even the trains are stylish.    Construction workers were replaced by ladies walking their dogs in expensive strollers. Fish from the local river were replaced by fish mongers with a fresh Hokkaido catch. And Nagomi here was definitely open.    At 11:30 or so, half an hour before opening, I was about 15th in line. This is a popular shop. I pity the soul who arrives after opening; you'll be here a long time.    This is the 追い鰹醤油らーめん, a shoyu ramen rich with katsuo flavors. Super dark brown, with a flavor to match. If you aren't a fan of rich, smoky fish flavors in your ramen, you've just wasted a couple hours of your life. More if you went to the closed shop first and had to take a bus for an extra 30 minutes to come here.  The shop's signature kurumabu - 車麩 - is an easy way to know your bowl is from Nagomi. Those circular things on top are actually friend bread slices from Okinawa. Kind of like bits of toast, they soak up the soup the way slices of baguette do in French onion soup.    Having spent an extra few hours on this adventure, I had to try their limited rice bowl. Fluffy scrambled egg, heavily flavored chashu, and a nice sauce over rice. It looks like they often have a limited donburi dish like this, which you should probably go for.

        "post": " 麺屋 丈六    I met the master of Joroku at a ramen event last year, and he came off as a real nice guy. Well, that niceness meant that he was constantly being invited to ramen collaborations with other shops, and every single time I tried to visit his downtown Osaka spot, they were unexpectedly closed. Either they were at an event, had run out of soup, or just decided to take a day off.  I learned a lesson about Osaka ramen here; be sure to check their twitter feed for updates. The masters here love twitter and it is the only reliable source of up-to-date shop info. You must be able to find their site and read Japanese; I can only help you out so much.    Joroku's super-central location (minutes from Namba Station, in a very lively part of town) means convenience. Not a particular criteria for a good bowl, but it's great to have a lot of before and after options. And while Joroku is on a rather shady street, more family-friendly fun isn't far away.    Getting down to the ramen, the standard bowl is 高井田系 - takaida-style. It's an Osaka thing, and it is wonderful. Deep, dark tamari shoyu is used. Shoyu 101 teaches us that tamari doesn't have the wheat added, resulting in a much heavier taste. If you've ever been served a special shoyu with sashimi, it was probably tamari.    Using this mega-soy sauce could easily result in a bowl that's too salty, so when a shop really makes it well, the fandom follows.  Feeling adventurous, I tried their limited 秋刀魚醤油らーめん - sanma ramen. Sanma, also called Pacific Saury, is an oily, flavorful fish that gives a big kick of flavor. A lighter, more normal soy sauce rounds out this one.    The two broths side by side.    I prefer the deeper soup. It's super intense, and really indicative of Osaka.  Looking at the menu, the sanma is one of their limited volume bowls. Joroku usually has one or two of these seasonal styles on the menu. An easy excuse to come back.

        "post": " The Best Ramen in Tokyo of 2016    These 14 shops are the definitive, best-of-the-best ramen shops in Tokyo in 2016.  Of course, I'm not being serious. The above was a one-day New Years pop up from Nishio that you will never be able to try, though they will probably have another one in January 2017. What I did was go through all my posts from 2016, a handful over 100 shops, and chose the ones that I consider true standouts. I have other, more organized best-of lists here and here, but this list could be considered a legit collection of must-crush bowls. I'll link to the individual reviews. Shops are in chronological order.     1. 田なか Second (Tanaka Second in Akihabara)  Simply noodles and soup. If simple means abalone and spiny lobster, and noodles made with a touch of rice flour for a stronger texture.  *Edit from July, 2017* Tanaka Second changed their menu, so you can no longer get this particular kakesoba.    2. らぁめん小池 (Koike in Kamikitazawa)  Solid bowl with standout toppings, including an egg that has been soaked in katsuo broth.    3. チョコひつじ (Chocolate Lamb Ramen at MENSHO TOKYO)  Sorry, another limited bowl. Lamb soup, fragrant spices, and bitter chocolate. Keep in mind that many shops to a Valentine's gentei; a limited bowl with chocolate.    4. 金時 (Kintoki in Nerima)  Kintoki's light shio ramen is great, but I was blown away by their excellent tantanmen.    5. やまぐち 辣式 (Yamaguchi Ratsushiki in Toyocho)  Another great spicy bowl. Yamaguchi's second shop had some big hot and numbing flavors.    6. 麦苗 (Muginae in Omori)  Not sure if I should post this. Muginae was poised to be the rookie shop of the year, but they rejected all media, including magazine awards. One of the most premium bowls in Tokyo.    7. 吉兆 (Kiccho in Oimachi)  An old school legend. Noodles made with bamboo poles, a technique almost nobody uses anymore.    8. 麺や 七彩 (Shichisai in Hatchobori)  I've always loved Shichisai. Their new shop takes things to another level with handmade noodles. They literally mix flour and water in front of your eyes, and go from there.    9. 伊吹 (Ibuki in Itabashi) - Review coming soon!  The king of niboshi lived up to all the hype. Rich, smoky, and slightly bitter.    10. 豚野郎 (Butayaro in Nakano) - Review coming soon  Heavier-than-average tonkotsu. Instead of extra noodles, go for zosui, a rice dish to dump in the left over soup.    11. 宮元 (Miyamoto in Kamata) - Review coming soon  Near-perfect execution of tsukemen. This style is abundant, but the big names you might have heard of are all franchises now. Miyamoto is legit.    12. 風見 (Kazami in Ginza) - Review soon  Fancy ramen made with sake lees, a byproduct of sake fermentation. Another Ginza shop that came out of nowhere.    13. 麺魚 (Mengyo in Kinshicho) - Review soon  Smoked chashu on a fish soup with a dashi-infused egg. This shop was the rookie shop of the year winner in multiple categories.     var amzn_wdgt={widget:'Carousel'}; amzn_wdgt.tag='ramenadven-20'; amzn_wdgt.widgetType='Bestsellers'; amzn_wdgt.searchIndex='Tokyo Travel Guides'; amzn_wdgt.browseNode='67658'; amzn_wdgt.title='Tokyo Guide Books'; amzn_wdgt.width='800'; amzn_wdgt.height='200';     ",

I was busy with other things, and had just finished with the Grand Tsukemen Festival, where I had 38 of the 40 available bowls. I was festivalled-out!    But then the usual suspects, the raota, the ramen nerds, told me to come down.    From ラーメンまこと屋 (Makotoya) in Osaka came this creamy paitan ramen blended with a beef soup. The sweetness from the beef stock was thinned by the thicker soup, if that makes sense. Fantastic.    This one from always-excellent Tomita used 山水地鶏, a brand of chicken considered by many as the best of the best. It was ok, nothing out of this world. Nice to try something different, I guess.  Just two bowls for me this time, and I'm fine with that. One of the ramen otaku there with us has been to every festival in Japan this year, sometimes traveling an entire day just to slurp and return. Good luck hitting 1000 shops this year!

        "post": " 寿製麺よしかわ 川越店    Yoshikawa in Saitama is one of the best ramen shops within driving distance of Tokyo. With their recent success, they were able to open a second shop in Kawagoe, also in Saitama Prefecture.    I was hungry and thirsty, and since I didn't do the driving, a glass of dassai sake would go nicely with a side of iwashidon - sardines on rice.    You can choose black or white ramen here, with the black being a bit deeper in flavor. Both are top of their class, but I say go for the darker version. It uses tamari shoyu, a stronger type seen a lot in Osaka.    If sardines aren't your thing, they have a daily kaisendon - various raw fish over rice. The shop is quite large, with tables for the family, so you can linger a bit longer than you might at a small, counter-only shop in Tokyo.    I noticed it late, but was able to change to have my sardines served over a small plate of noodles. The shop makes their own, and these fresh raw sardines, hit with lemon vinegar and onion, were a standout. Almost a meal on its own.    The shop's ingredients are on display, including a premium tamari soy sauce.    And an equally high quality craft soy sauce.    A must-hit if you live in Saitama, and probably worth it for out of towners as well.      埼玉県川越市今福1738-14 Saitama-ken, Kawagoe-shi, Imafuku 1738-14 Closest station: Kawagoe  Open 11:00-15:00, 17:00-21:00 Saturdays 11:00-21:00 Closed Sundays  ",

        "post": " ラーメン ヤスオ    I'd noticed Yasuo mentioned in magazines, on blogs, and even on a narrow search of highly ranked shops in my neighborhood. I've known about them for years.    Why did it take so long? Well, they are in the realm of jiro-kei; shops that serve ramen in the style of Ramen Jiro.    Jiro is not my cup of tea. Mainly because I don't like my tea to make me stink of garlic and rendered pork fat for the next 12 to 18 hours.  I shouldn't judge, though. While the ヤスじろう option is strictly jiro-kei, the others aren't quite at that level. Go for ラうどん - ra-udon - if you like your noodles super thick, or ラそば - ra-soba - if you like them thin.    Most people go with the thick ones, and most people come back.    If this is jiro-kei, then it is officially my favorite bowl of that genre. The noodles are the bomb, and the soup intense but drinkable. Spinach greens play nicely with a very meaty bowl, giving it some healthy vitamins. Most Jiro style bowls are covered with nutrient-lacking bean sprouts and cabbage.  And as I had nothing to do the rest of the day, I added a bit of freshly minced garlic. Definitely recommended.      東京都渋谷区代々木2-29-3-1F Tokyo, Shibuya-ku, Yoyogi 2-29-3 Closest station: Minami-Shinjuku  Open 11:30-19:30 Saturday 11:30-15:00 Closed Sundays  ",

What I wanted was, apparently, the best tsukemen shop in Tokyo according to a few lists. So when I finally made it out to this shop, waited in the long line (a dozen or so before opening), and got ready for the best tsukemen of my life . . .    I'll translate. Today, we are only serving shio ramen. Yeah, sometimes they make a different menu, and people like me that didn't check their twitter account are left dumbfounded.    In the end, though, a highly ranked shop probably makes a mean second brand, so let's dig in.    They are going for something simple, with a solid balance.    A good bowl, but not one I would make the trek for again. I was with a friend, a kid who worked as a chef at some of the world's top restaurants, and he was shocked at how creamy the soup was, using only chicken (chicken feet are the key, said the chef). Go for the special bowl, as it comes with some tasty wontons.    The thick, creamy anindofu, a kind of pudding, was above and beyond acceptable as a desert.      東京都葛飾区亀有5-28-17 Tokyo, Katsushika-ku, Kameari 5-28-17 Closest station: Kameari  Open 11:30 until the soup runs out, usually around 19:00.

I believe I could have made it look appetizing if I had my Fuji XT-1 camera; this is the first post in ages that I used an iPhone for. But in my defense, I didn't think I would be eating ramen this evening, in the middle of nowhere Nagoya.    But I have a star on my map, indicating a ramen shop that had somehow caught my eye, but was too far away for immediate action.    My hotel for the evening was at the intersection of the bullet train and local, near Mikawa-Anjo Station.    So that is how I ended up at Oiwatei. Why was this one on my ramen radar? What is so special? Thickest soup in Japan. Eccentric chef.    Yes on both accounts. The chef screams as he shakes the noodles from the boiling water. Haaaaaaa! Eeeeeeeee!  He also takes his sweet time. When I arrived, there were eight people ahead of me in line. Standard, and the usual formula is four minutes a person wait. But the master's screams came infrequently. It took me almost two hours before I could sit, and another 30 minutes before I was presented my bowl.    Yeah, that is my spoon standing up in the soup. I remember old Dennison's chili commercials as a child boasting that you could stand a fork in the bowl. Well, this ain't chili, this is soup. Ungodly thick soup.  *A quick cultural note: Never stand your chopsticks up in food in Japan, especially rice. This is done during a traditional funeral ceremony as an offering to the deceased. I asked a few people if a spoon was ok, and no one knew for sure. The general consensus is that it is fine. The above shot was taken by everyone who came here.    This bowl was horrible. If I were judging on taste alone, then it would be a different story. The soup was like drinking a pig, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Despite the wait, I'd say the novelty factor would put this one on a list of strange, yet interesting ramen in Japan. I might have actually come back.  No, the problem was a serious one. On my first slurp, something sharp hit my tongue. Spitting it into a napkin revealed its nature. A shard of pork bone. Then another, and another. Each slurp had to be done with care, followed by the oral removal of real shattered bone bits. I stopped after five or six miserable bites, paid, and left.      愛知県安城市緑町1-16-9 Aichi-ken, Anjo-shi, Midoricho 1-16-9 Closest station: Mikawa-Anjo  Open 11:00-14:00, 17:00-21:00 Closed Mondays  ",

        "post": " 銀座 風見    Ginza continues to surprise. First, there was Kagari, which has been completely discovered; if you don't mind a long line of mostly foreigners, it still serves an amazing bowl. Then there was Mugitooribu, whose inclusion on many best-of lists is well deserved.    The latest spot to hit is Kazami.    Kazami is located down a small alley, like many awesome hidden restaurants in Ginza, inside a sleek modern building with a sushi restaurant on the second floor.    The one to order is the 酒粕濃厚そば, sake kasu noko soba. Made with sake lees, a byproduct of nihonshu production. As yeast eats sugar and creates alcohol, an organic sediment builds up. Not something you would want in your drink (although a little can add interest flavors), it is generally discarded.    But it can be used. Here, it adds a deep flavor to the ramen. Similar in some ways to miso, but not as salty or pungent. A bit bitter, but not overly so. Something anyone should try if they have a chance.    As the flavor can be seen as funky to some, there are plenty of condiment options to tweak your soup. Vinegar, sansho pepper, dried red pepper, yuzusco sauce, ground pepper, yuzukosho, and fresh ginger. Don't overdo it.    This is one of my favorite new bowls of 2016. The ingredients are all top quality. A must-slurp in my opinion.    The side of seasonal vegetables was a nice touch.    Ohata-san knocked this anticipated shop out. Well done.        東京都中央区銀座6-4-13 Tokyo, Chuo-ku, Ginza 6-4-13 Closest station: Ginza  Open 11:30-15:30, 17:30-22:30  ",

And according to the curated Tabelog 50, one of the best in Japan.    The upper left, in this case, is 特製極濃煮干しつけ麺, tokuseigokukoniboshitsukemen. Breaking it down we get special, mega-thick, dried sardine tsukemen.    You won't be alone, please observe the rules of the line.    This. Bowl.    Yeah, this one is tops. I have trouble ranking the upper echelon of thick tsukemen shops because each one is just so amazing. From the image, to the smell, to the first bite, to the lasting umami aftertaste. As the name of the shop implies, Miyamoto is heavy with niboshi, dried fish, particularly sardines. The creaminess of the pork, the bitter, smoky punch of the fish, and a hint of yuzu citrus to mellow the whole thing out.    And the line, though strict rules apply, wasn't that bad.    東京都大田区西蒲田7-8-1 Tokyo, Ota-ku, Nishikamata 7-8-1 Closest station: Kamata  Open 11:00-15:00, 18:00-21:00 Closed Wednesdays  ",

Sure, Shinjuku's Kabukicho red light district is full of cheap spots, but I'm not looking for cheap.    Enter Butayaro. About halfway between Nakano and Higashi-Nakano Stations, right next to the big home supply store (if you live in the neighborhood, you probably know it). It's really not far from civilization, but it feels like it in the strictly residential neighborhood.    Go for the set. I'll explain in a minute.    A bit more intense than expected, which is a great thing when searching for above average tonkotsu. I found it less smooth than those shops as well, which matches perfectly with the name; Yaro means dude, so this shop could be called dude pork.    Normally, with this style, you would order kaedama, an extra serving of noodles. Here, though, it's all about zosui. A side of flavored rice gets dumped in. Dude pork for sure.    The rice amplifies the flavor in ways that noodles can't. Like I said, go for the set.    Go Carps! Apparently, the owner loves Hiroshima, and has a small collection of his favorite baseball team goods.    It's Ramenate!    東京都中野区中野1丁目41番45号 Tokyo, Nakano-ku, Nakano 1-41-45 Closest staiton: Nakano  Open 11:30-15:30, 18:00-22:30 Weekends 11:30-16:00, 18:00-22:30 Closed Tuesdays  ",

Nakanobu isn't on many people's radars, especially tourists, but it well could be. Takano is just off the famous Skip Road, a covered shopping street that stretches 330 meters. It's a cool, old-school side of Tokyo, not that far from the center.    And despite the English menu, Takano is a cool, old-school ramen shop.    The hours may have been longer in the past, but now it is strictly lunch.    Classic Tokyo style. Two kinds of Japanese chicken are used for the stock, and plenty of dried fish for that smoky punch that defines Tokyo ramen.    The tsukemen soup is made from pork and duck, a solid match with the whole grain noodles.    Noodles that are made in house, and are a big draw for fans of this style.    Ms. Takano-san is still here, serving bowl after bowl to the masses.    The entire menu is actually quite extensive, with the spicy sesame bowl looking like another winner.    You'll probably wait 20-30 minutes, but you'll have checked off one that is worthy of a visit or two.      東京都品川区中延2-15-10 Tokyo, Shinagawa-ku, Nakanobu 2-15-10 Closest station: Ebaranakanobu  Open 11:30-14:30 Closed Wednesdays  ",

Dried baby sardines in this concentration aren't for everyone, not by a long shot. Are they for you?    Start at a normal ramen spot, one that serves a light shoyu ramen. It will have a bit of the stuff. That faint, smoky aftertaste is probably from niboshi, or other dried fish. It adds a lot of umami, and a bit of bitterness. It is this bitter flavor that divides opinions.  If you like it, head somewhere with a bit more niboshi punch. Most tonkotsugyokai tsukemen shops have a lot of these bitter dried fish flavors. Still loving it? Then head to Ibuki.    The menu has a few options. Go with the 濃厚中華ソバ, thick chinese noodles. The old addage of going to the upper right won't work here. It is 800 yen, and right in the middle. There is a lighter soup version and well as a super thick version, but they aren't available every time. The menu also changes slightly at lunch time. Good luck.    A thing of beauty. If you haven't guessed, I am a niboshi addict. Some of the best flavors in the world in my opinion. Smoky, salty, and a bit pungent.    So, is Ibuki the worthy king of niboshi? They have a 98.50 rating over at the Ramen Database, and a 4.04 over at Tabelog (putting them not only at #4 countrywide for ramen, but in the top 500 of all restaurants in Japan).  I'd say yes, this is one of the best bowls you could possibly slurp.

Never be critical about ramen when I'm with my non-ramen friends or coworkers. Slurp anything, smile, and keep your opinion to yourself. I've found that most people in Japan are quick to compliment food. I blame the constant flow of food shows; no one ever says anything apart from oooooooishi!    So when my coworkers wanted to go to one of the only shops in this sleepy town, I tagged along without a comment.    I slurped, nodded my head when the Japanese staff I work with exclaimed their oishis, and kept the negativity to myself.    Not bad, but nothing to go crazy about. At 600 yen it's not a waste of money.  Sorry Saga. I come here once every two years or so, and always stay by the station. Maybe I need to search a bit more, but the area has nothing of interest to me. Cool bar? Cafe? Restaurant? I'll keep up the search.    There is a famous song (subtitled version here) about how lame Saga is. If you mention Saga as \"S. A. G. A. Saga\" you will get a laugh from your Japanese friends. It's like when you call Saitama Prefecture dasaitama, literally uncool ball. Sure you'll offend someone sooner or later, but it's fun to talk trash about the sticks.    Will Saga ever be cool?

Maybe you could figure out the train, then hop a bus or two, then walk if you want to make it to Bunryu, one of Kumamoto's most famous shops.    The upper left of the ticket machine is tonkotsu black. There's a red option somewhere to the right, but I wasn't going to tempt fate with an unknown spicy bowl.    The upper left choice is also labeled as こってり - thick. A handwritten sign above says that it is actually 超こってり - super thick. Perfect.  My friend got the thinner あっさり version.    By the way, thick in this case means a healthy mound of seabura back fat on top. My kind of thick!  My kind of ramen.  Kumamoto ramen is rough with full flavors. Lots of pork and lots of garlic. Think of it as your standard Kyushu tonkotsu ramen plus.    Be careful with the minced shoyu garlic, a staple of Kumamoto ramen shops.

The prefecture's top ranked spots are all in remote locations, with odd hours, and none of them match their days off. So on a recent road trip, I picked one shop, Kanadaya, the highest ranked shop, to check off the list.    Actually, they exist overseas in London. Hey, I recognize that car!    I had very high hopes for this one. It was 2016 that would change my mind about tonkotsu ramen in Kyushu. I'd never, in the eight or so years of Ramen Adventures, had a stellar bowl. Plenty of great ones. Eights and even nines, but never a ten.  I had my first ten at Genki Ippai. I had my second at Kanadaya.    This was pork perfection. The soup is buttery and smooth, without any funk. Chashu sliced so thin that it would dissolve if it wasn't lovingly placed on the sides of the bowl. Just a touch of the standard green onion and kikurage mushroom.    The egg was next level.  I'm sorry to say that this shop isn't so convenient. About an hour from any major city, and that is if you take the bullet train. Even longer if you take a wallet-friendly local. But if you want the best, you have to work for it in Kyushu.  Actually, they have a couple branch shops in Koba (here), Hiroshima (here), and central Hakata (here). I love the vibe of the main shop, in the middle of nowhere.      福岡県行橋市大橋1-4-3 Fukuoka-ken, Yukuhashi-shi, Ohashi 1-4-3 Closest station: Yukuhashi  Open 11:00-15:00. 17:00-20:00 Closed Thursdays  ",

I took advantage last year, when they sent me to Okinawa in November, to slurp Yanbaru, Stripe, and Kishimoto. Head down early on a Wednesday, spend three days cruising around slurping noodles, and then head back.    But this time, I had an engagement during the week, so I was only in Naha, the main Okinawa city, for a night. I asked my fellow Awamori drinkers at a food stand near the hotel if there was a good shop, and they said the only one open was Sanchome. This was my only choice for Okinawa's sokisoba.    Just past Chocolate Milk Street.    Wow, I forgot how cheap eats are the further south you go. Only 450 yen for the standard bowl.    I went with the 700 yen version, which included a few more toppings.    Meh is my review. I've had some great food on Okinawa, so I'm not pulling any punches. Sokisoba is always done with a very light soup, which was almost flavorless in this case. The toppings, the trifecta of Okinawa, weren't the best. Fish cake, pork belly, and rib meat were present, but nowhere near as hearty as hoped.    See you next year. My 2017 goals include taking full advantage of my working situation. If I get sent to Okinawa, I'll block off a few days for noodles. Okinawa requires time and transportation. While Naha is packed, the best noodles are on the other side of the island.      沖縄県那覇市久茂地3-26-1 Okinawa, Naha-shi, Kumoji 3-26-1 Closest station: The airport?  ",

The Ramendb is heavily weighted by Jiro lovers, and Butaboshi is Jiro-style.    The only thing thicker than the noodles is the soup. Scratch that, the chunks of pork are thicker still.    I'm not a fan of this style, and I felt bad for leaving what looked like half the bowl when I left. But, as I know from experience, the human body is not meant to overeat ramen of this caliber.    Try it for yourself, but only if you are a fan. The location is out of the way.    Another warning, you will stink after this one. Garlic and rendered pork fat.

Well, the master loves his off-the-wall creations. In fact, he has around 50 of them. Any day here and you will see one on the board. Today's special.    Today's special was nachosoba. A sauce made from Japanese miso and Mexican spices, topped with all manner of Mexican themed toppings. Corn chips, ground chorizo, nacho cheese. The master is either a genius, or insane.    I come here on random Wednesdays, as the shop is near a school I teach English at occasionally.    I'm always looking forward to the next thing. Like I said, he had a folder with around 50 of his creations.    Miura-san, the shop's chef, used to work at cafes. He honed a cooking style of tasty comfort food, and then brought that over to his ramen. Many people have laughed, even called some of his things the complete opposite of ramen. But he doesn't care. Customers vote with their yen, and the shop is usually packed.    The only thing outnumbering the customers are the collectible figures displayed in glass cases on the wall. Star Wars, Marvel, DC, and of course,    Breaking Bad. I haven't seen if he has a meth-blue lunch special, but I wouldn't be surprised.      東京都品川区大井1-37-4 Tokyo, Shinagawa-ku, Oimachi 1-37-4 Closest station: Oimachi  Open 11:00-14:00, 17:30-20:00 Saturday 11:00-14:00 Closed Thursdays and Sundays  ",

        "post": " Mikkeller らーめんとビール    Most beer fans have nothing but praise for Mikkeller, and I am among them. Mikkeller started in Denmark back around 2006 with a unique concept. Instead of operating a main brewery, they would outsource their recipes, with experimental brews being commonplace. They collaborate around the world, and their Tokyo bar was a place of beauty (though it closed down last year due to drama with their partners).    When in Copenhagen, it is almost impossible to find a street without Mikkeller represented in some way or another.  One this street, for example, I passes an artisinal toast shop with a Mikkeller sign in the window before arriving at the Mikkeller ramen shop. Yes, they opened a ramen shop.  And, yes, I went to Copenhagen for a quick food vacation. I was here to visit two shops in particular, Slurp Ramen Joint and Noma. With Copenhagen being very, very cold (minus eight one day), I spent more time inside restaurants than expected. It's easy to blame gluttony on the weather.    At first glance, this is an impressive shop. Knick knacks from old Japan cover the walls, and they even went so far as to import a real Japanese ticket machine. It's just a novelty; print your ticket, and pay at the counter.    Shio, shoyu, and a spicy miso, plus a few seasonal bowls. With temperatures hovering around zero outside (protip: avoid Denmark in January), I went straight for the spicy miso, level two.    And of course, a glass of their \"ramen\" beer, a light Belgian ale that pairs well with the food.  The ramen here was good. I would slurp this regularly if I chose Copenhagen as my home, though I would not have been happy waiting an hour for it (this was the case when the shop first opened). But on a cold Copenhagen day this was a perfect heat me up and leave me happy lunch.    Official site here.

Back when the shop was a gem, when tsukemen of this caliber was a relatively new thing.  It was an epic experience, and an epic bowl. After a wait of an hour or more, I sat next to a high-level gangster, shoulder-to-shoulder, as we slurped this meaty, noodly food of the gods. They operated their shop by serving the entire place at once, and seating the next group when the current group of 15 was finished. A crazy system that would only work in the rural Osaki neighborhood they were located in.  Everyone loved this shop. Japanese media and food critics raved. David Chang still mentions it to this day. Unfortunately, this is a problem. The shop was constantly having issues with neighbors. This was, after all, a residential neighborhood. I'm sure my eating neighbor, the yakuza, didn't help the matter. Rokurinsha's master sold the brand sometime a few years later, after the success of the shop at the newly opened Tokyo Ramen Street.  Since then, Rokurinsha has opened in malls and airports, with a central kitchen and system much different than the original.    As I was flying out of Haneda, I took the chance to eat here, something I thought I would never do again.    Get your buzzing order-ready thing, and wait about 10 minutes.    Self service toppings and soup wari are there for your enjoyment.    So here it is.  I feel like comparing apples and oranges. Both are good, I just really prefer apples. The Rokurinsha of yesteryear was worthy of a pilgrimage. You can still watch shows on Netflix that talk about the old shop. Watch them, and you'll be on the next flight.  The new Rokurinsha is a standard thing. If you've never had a good tonkotsugyokai tsukemen, then this is going to knock your socks off. You'll Instagram it, recommend it to friends, and feel accomplished. So the cycle continues.  My goal with Ramen Adventures, when I started the site back in 2008 (Rokurinsha was my 10th post) was to help people find something truly unique. I can't think of anything in an airport or shopping mall food court that would apply.    Official site here.    東京都大田区羽田空港2-6-5 羽田空港国際線旅客ターミナル Haneda International Terminal  Open 24/7  ",

As if the smell wasn't enough.    They are known for their shio ramen, made with あご, dried flying fish. If you thought all shio ramen was light and simple, you'd be proven wrong here.    As with any Yokohama-style, plenty of garlic, ginger, and other condiments for you to kick up your bowl.    And with all Yokohama-style bowls, choose your level of flavor, amount of oil, and firmness of noodles. Futsu if it is your first time. Futsu means normal.    My friend was here with her parents, a Malaysian family, and dad said that the all-you-can-eat rice option would never work anywhere else. Families would sit down and never leave. It's only 50 yen, about 40 cents, for as many refills as you like.    The bowl here is very normal in the realm of ie-kei. I could finish, which puts it in the top 10% for my personal taste. Not saying much, except that I'm a guy who doesn't go for these heavier soups as my bowl of choice.  Regardless, you can get a mini bowl for only 550 yen, and beautiful Inokashira Park is just a minute away. You'll find a few tourists here for those reasons, but nothing crazy like Harajuku or Akihabara, which are packed with travelers these days.  By the way, for someone looking for a bit of niceness in Tokyo, stroll east from Inokashira Park along the river. You can walk for hours, and it is a little hidden gem of an outing.

        "post": " 味噌麺処 楓    One of Tokyo's best miso ramen joints is Hanamichi, out west in Nerima. It's a heavy bowl, with a massive punch of salty miso. It should come as no surprise that when a disciple of this shop decides to become a master, he sticks with what he knows.    Ogikubo is convenient, though this shop is a bit of a walk from the station. I used to live out here, so these are familiar streets, but it might seem like you are headed into the residential heart of nowhere as you stray farther and farther from the station.    Even though it's out there, expect a short line. Or a long one.    Miro or spicy miso. Your choice. And don't forget a side of seasoned quail eggs.    The bowl is on par with Hanamichi, if not better. With the addition of a ginger paste on the top, the overall bowl is similar yet different. Similar in the cooking process, where soup is reduced with vegetables in a wok.    Different with that new topping. The 生姜あん, a thick and flavorful ginger punch, goes so well with the miso. Other famous miso shops are known for a bit of freshly grated ginger, but this is next level. No wonder Kaede was named the rookie miso of 2016.

After a successful shop in San Francisco, and an even more successful shop in a food court in Kawasaki, Shono-san is back in his home area, taking residency in the old Chabuya ramen shop (an amazing shop that has been closed for about 5 years now).    The concept here, as with every Mensho shop, is a bit different. Farm to bowl, with a focus on the harmony of the five elements.    No, not earth, wind, fire, water, and metal. Soup, tare, oil, noodles, and toppings.    When I went soon after they opened, there were just two options on the menu. Shio ramen and stone-milled tsukemen. I went shio with an extra side of duck chashu.    Wow, this one impresses.    The soup and noodles are normal, if normal means snapper and scallop soup with Japanese sea salt from Oshima and Ishikawa.    Toppings are where this one gets unique. Little scallop bites, dusted with burnt onion powder. Umami bombs. The yellow is karasumi, cured fish roe. I've only seen karasumi in expensive seafood restaurants. Definitely a first for a ramen shop.    The duck was excellent, but you should really be ordering more of the chicken. Pressed in konbu, then cooked sous vide, this was some of the most tender, flavorful chicken I've had on any bowl of ramen in Tokyo.    The tsukemen pulls no punches either.    Stone ground flour. Freshly ground. This is probably your only chance to taste noodles made so fresh.  Served with two cups of broth. One is a light duck and vegetable broth. The other is a small serving of onsen water from Kagoshima. Noodles dipped in water, something I've never seen before.    The shop is only open for lunch these days, but that will probably change. A must-hit if you want a modern, stylish bowl.    Site here.           東京都文京区音羽1-17-16 Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Otowa 1-17-16 Closest Station: Gokokuji  Open 11:00-15:00 Closed Tuesdays  ",

Fun shop that I would encourage anyone to try at least once. Every new Keisuke shop feels like a limited-time gentei bowl, and most are ones I would never slurp a second time. This fugu ramen falls in that category.    Have you had fugu before? The flavor is almost non-existent. I've eaten my fair share of the stuff, from $300 a person VIP places to a buck a piece deep-fried street-food fugu. My favorite is the deep fried, because it tastes like it has been fried. Fugu meat, with its lack of flavor, I honestly don't get it.  I welcome anyone who can school me on the fugu world and why it is so prevalent in Japan.    Back to the ramen. Go for the full deal (1650 yen, upper-left on the machine). You'll get the bowl, plus an extra plate of goodies.    Lots of attention to detail here. The menma is heavily seasoned, the chashu sous vide. The egg is awesome.    As for the soup, it is light and delicate. You'll get a slight fish flavor, nothing too intense. This bowl is what I would imagine fugu ramen should taste like.    They have more expensive sets that include a bowl of rice to pour the soup into, but that seemed like too much food. Also, deep fried fugu, but they were sold out when I went.    Official site here.           東京都中央区銀座5-2-1 Tokyo, Chuo-ku, Ginza 5-2-1 Closest station: Ginza  Open 11:00-11:00  ",

Fuji, so the frequent rainwater collects a massive amount of minerals as it drizzles to the sea. This mineral-rich water feeds the konbu seaweed, making it some of the best in Japan. To put its level of excellence into gourmet terms, the chef at Noma, considered the world's best restaurant, who is fanatical about local product, imports Rishiri konbu to his Copenhagen shop.    I visited the island a few years ago, with the intent of summiting the famous mountain.    Crushed it!    So when a Rishiri konbu ramen shop opens, I'm in it as soon as possible.    Go for the shio. The whole point of using an ultra high grade seaweed is to savor the delicate umami.    And Kuroobi has it.  I prefer the shio ramen here. No big flavor impact, so you can focus on the smooth seaweed aftertaste.    The master, who hails from the island, named his shop black belt after the image of dark Rishiri konbu.             東京都港区芝公園2-3-8 Tokyo, Minato-kui, Shibakoen 2-3-8 Closest station: Daimon  Open 11:00-15:00, 17:00-22:00 Saturday 11:00-20:00 Closed Sundays  ",

Well, I got a TV gig, and the topic was Takadanobaba ramen ranking. They gave me a list of 60 shops to comment on. No I didn't hit all of them, but made it a point to seek out a few top contenders I had yet to slurp.    Sanpoichi is as light as light chicken ramen can get. A clear broth with hints of umami. Very refined. Noodles made in house really stand out. Firm and wheaty.    The homemade rayu hot oil was a nice addition, but be careful, it can overpower the subtle umami of this one.    Crushed it! These are the perfect bowls for cold days. To me, it feels like mom's chicken soup kicked up with something extra.  I enjoyed this one, but it didn't make the TV show's Top 7, which were the only ones to make it on air. They said they interviewed 1000 people to make the list.  For your info, here it is.

I learned a lesson today. More isn't always better. When the master asked the levels of spice, I went normal. As for the numbing pepper, I went 大. I went big.  It wasn't until my third or fourth bite that I actually read the info sheet (more of a warning sheet). For the 辛さ, the spiciness, the middle is the shop's standard, and recommended for normal people. I can attest, it was just right. But the 痺れ, numbing level, has a different suggestions. For first timers, go 小, go small. If you like bitter, go normal. If you are a bit crazy, go big.    So yeah, this one was way over-spiced, a folly that was completely my fault. I powered through, but didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. Those pre-shock bites, the first, second, and third, were great.    Tantan Tiger has a selection of side veggies; avocado, tomato, and cilantro among others.    A lovely onsen tamago helped the heat a bit.    I was with the staff of MOTO NAVI magazine, and as they were featuring me in their magazine, I had to save face and finish the entire bowl. The good thing about sansho is that it doesn't linger.

Yes, that is very specific. You should take these rankings with a grain of salt, as the field can be quite sparse. Although many ramen shops open and close in Tokyo every year, the number in each category can be small.    I'm not a huge fan of lighter tsukemen, but the bowl here has something special.    Two kinds of noodles. Thick, and thin.    All in all, having two kinds of noodles was a gimmick to me, and it meant that, though I liked one more, I also liked one less.

This new shop cooks their soup with the shellfish, pulling out the maximum umami that these little guys hold.    You might as well get a side of oyster snacks while you wait.    Very interesting bowl. Personally, I love it, but could see some people not being into this oyster ramen.    The soup is liquid oyster gold. Almost like drinking concentrated extract. I'd like to hear the opinion of one of my oyster nerd friends. The soup is free of chemical seasoning, something I always like to see. Almost all ramen shops in Japan rely on a pinch of Ajinomoto, pure MSG, for that extra bit of umami. Here, that strong oyster flavor comes packed with plenty of natural MSG. Nothing more needed.    Although this shop has failed to become very popular, I think it is at least worth a try.             東京都渋谷区幡ヶ谷2-6-7 Tokyo, Shibuya-ku, Hatagaya 2-6-7 Closest station: Hatagaya  Hours aren't official yet, but it looks like 11:30am until midnight.

You can view it here:  https://youtu.be/cCIJxmacFt0  Well, the dude is, at heart, a ramen nerd, and we immediately went to crush another bowl.    Shinohara comes from the Honda group, a group that has been churning out a lot of Tokyo talent. New school refined is a good way to describe their styles. Choice ingredients, and lots of them. Chicken, beef, pork, and fish heads all go into the soup. The tare seasoning uses craft soy sauce from Ohitachi (お常陸), out of Ibaraki Prefecture.  Rich, but not overly salty, with a complex umami aftertaste. My kind of bowl.    The entire menu looks great. Top row is the shoyu, which I had. Probably your best bet for the first time. Below that is a lighter dashi bowl. And in orange a bowl made with tai fish.  Add to that a constant rotation of limited bowls and rice bowls, and you've got a place I wouldn't mind coming back to.    I had to rush off to a TV shoot for another two bowls, so I'm thankful that the noodles at Shinohara were on the lighter, easy-to-slurp side.

Two Michelin stars. Tabelog Gold status. In other words, fine dining.  I've been to L'Effervescence for lunch before, and it was a delight. But even their cheapest option is quite pricey, and out of the price range of anyone looking for a casual slurp.  So when Namae-san did a quick pop-up at a fermentation festival in Tokyo, I was first in line.    Katsuo, blocks of skipjack tuna smocked dry into flavorful umami rocks. Shave them down; a little goes a long way. Different levels were used for different purposes, and some of the best were shaved fresh onto the top of the ramen.    The soup is hit with homemade sour cream, another level of fermentation umami.  All in all, an interesting one-off bowl. I'd probably never go for this again, but I was happy to try ramen from such an accomplished chef.    Official festival site here. L'Effervescence site here.

Considered to be the best in Kanagawa by many (#8 in Japan here). The shop isn't too far from central Yokohama, so a ramen hunter in the area doesn't have far to go.    Master Nishikaki-san (西垣さん) spent the early years of his culinary life in Italian cooking. So why didn't he open his own Italian place? One of the reasons is that he likes the hospitality aspect of ramen shops. Customers sit at the counter, watching the chef. It's a kind of direct interaction that you don't get anywhere else.    Special shingen (信玄鶏) chickens from Yamanashi for the soup and toppings. While the soup is a simple chicken stock, the tare seasoning is quite complex. Somewhere between three and five soy sauces are blended and cooked with dried fish, shrimp, and seaweed.  It's an amazing base for the plethora of tasty toppings that you'll get with the special bowl.    Low temperature cooked pork chashu as well as chicken breast, thigh, and meatball.    Everything is top notch.    The egg is, of course, as close to perfect as you can get. The wonton is just an added bonus.    Always a line, and if the spot wasn't all the way down in southern Yokohama, I'd be there more often. A quick glance online and it looks like they make a few limited bowls, like a thicker paitan soup or some spicy styles.  This one will make my best-of-2017 list easily.             神奈川県横浜市南区吉野町4-20 Kanagawa-ken, Yokohama-shi, Minami-ku, Yoshinocho 4-20 Closest station: Yoshinocho  Open 11:00-14:00, 18:00-21:00 Weekends 11:00-15:00 Closed Mondays  ",

The visiting shops are all interesting, but this one in particular had me excited.    Years ago, I visited Rishiri Island, just about the farthest north you can go in Japan. While there, I tried a ramen shop, was massively disappointed, and figured that the island's famous konbu seaweed had no effect on the local eats. I few weeks later, the director of the museum told me about a ramen shop on the other side of the island, a shop that was rich and full of local umami. I completely missed out, and Rishiri isn't the kind of place you visit often.    Years later, and they (the good shop) are popping up shop in Yokohama. Now's my chance!    You know your island is obscure when your business card has to explain where it is.    Well, most foodies know about Rishiri, and chefs from around the world love this konbu in particular.    Quite an impact in this bowl. A bowl of 焼き醤油らーめん - fried soy sauce ramen.    While most ramen simply ladles in a spoonfull of soy sauce tare seasoning, Miraku fries it up in a wok. This gives it a stronger, almost burnt flavor. Add this initial impact to the mellow umami from the Rishi seaweed and you've got a solid bowl.    After meeting the super nice elderly shop staff, I might just have to make a trip back north. One of these days.    Very easy to crush this one.    They will be at the museum for the near future, maybe a year and a half or so.

Billed as 焼麺, yakimen, this bowl uses noodles that have been fried on the teppan grill. Add to that a slice of chashu that looks more like bacon, and a fried egg, and you've go what I call breakfast ramen.    As with any unique ramen, there is an instruction sheet telling the customer how to eat it. Even though I tried, this one was a challenge. The noodles are all fried together, and my chopstick skills aren't high enough to easily cut the mass.  If I were to go back, I might get the non-fried version with regular noodles.    Despite the challenge of how to eat, this bowl was awesome. The soup is concentrated and thick.    Fresh ground katsuo flakes add another layer of smokiness to the bowl.    They've been visited by celebrities. Actually, this was for research on my part for an upcoming TV show about ramen in the area. Tsurugi was given the bronze out of 60 shops.

Spicy mazesoba with cheese.   I'll go for No. 3!    A big bowl of junk food. Mix it up and go to town.    Well, I don't think it was a ramen nerd who recommended this one. Very oily, with a handful of store-bought processed cheese thrown on top.  The rest of the menu (we tried a few bowls) was mediocre as well.

He was here for a week-long crash course, and I was there for a couple days to help translate. What did we do after six hours of ramen testing? Get more ramen of course.    Kaigaraya let's you know exactly what goes into their bowl; oysters.    It's strange, but for me oyster ramen seems like a recent trend, despite places like Kaigaraya being open since 2014. Oyster ramen is quite an intense taste, not something I could see finding a huge following.    Despite the strong flavors going on, I am into this one.    A creamy, paitan style soup with the basic toppings. Very simple apart from the complex soup.    The tsukemen comes with a side of oyster paste for an extra kick. I prefer the normal カキソバ, but some people might go for the extra volume that tsukemen offers.    Kind of out there in terms of accessibility, but if, for some reason, you are out here, you might want to pop in. Fortunately, it is in the area of the RaJuku ramen school.

They run Miraie, a popular shop up in Akabane.    Well, I made it, and I even made a video about it. This is one of the first videos I've filmed and edited all on my own. Please let me know what you think.    There are a few options on the menu. The staff actually wanted me to try the Tokyo shoyu ramen, an all-natural soy based bowl, but I had my eyes on the mazesoba, a soupless dish topped with stewed beef.    Gyu nikomi mazesoba. Stewed beef mix-em-up noodles.    It did not disappoint. The beef is stewed in wine, craft soy sauce, and spices. It's all kinds of decadent. It comes out looking very sharp in that triangular bowl.    Make it messy. Remember, with mazesoba, mix it vigorously for about a minute. Don't stir, mix. The gluten in the noodles is activated by your efforts.    Cabernet from Chile.    Shoyu from Chiba.    Slowly stewed until it is chopstick tender.    A lot of people who watched the video put this on their hit lists, and I don't blame them.

        "post": " misato    Seabura is a thing of beauty. This style of ramen, sometimes called seabura chatcha (back-fat-sprinkled) was a direct result of customers in Tokyo's red light district requesting more and more hunks of silky smooth fat in their bowls. This was a long time ago, in the 1960s, and since then many shops have followed suit.    misato isn't far from said red light district.    Although shoyu is presented in the upper left, go for the shio next to it. You want to savor all the seabura, right?    Actually, you can choose your level.  Noodle firmness? Katame (hard). Flavor strength? Futsu (regular). Seabura amount? Ome (extra).    Large pieces of simmered back fat are shaken through a strainer to break them up.    Some people think of pork fat as tough, inedible bits, but this stuff is practically liquid.    Maybe don't crush the bowl if your body isn't accustomed to this sort of soup.

        "post": " ３種の地鶏と猪のかけラーメン    I shy away from posting too many gentei, limited release, bowls of ramen. They happen all the time, with famous shops often doing seasonal variations, special bowls for anniversaries, and, in this case, a bowl built for TV.    This show in particular was of interest to me. The name is 激戦区！頂上めしGP, which is a kind of local food battle program. This time the food was ramen and the place was Takadanobaba.    Spoilers; Yamaguchi got the top spot.  I'm a huge fan of Yamaguchi, and would put it at my number 1 for the area as well. This was from a list of 60 or so shops in about a three mile radius. That's a lot of ramen!    Why was I interested in this show in particular? I was on it!  Four ramen commentators were interviewed about the top eight shops, with special emphasis on the top two. Above is Layla, a famous female ramen critic. Below is Maejima-san, the guy behind the Setagaya ramen group.  Where am I? I was only on air for about six seconds. Yeah, a full day shoot for six seconds. That's par for the course though, when it comes to the type of media work I do.    Yamaguchi won the general ranking, but the show took things a step further. The top two shops had to create a custom, one-off bowl that would wow the judges. This is what Yamaguchi created.    Just soup and noodles. No toppings.    But that soup is something extraordinary. Made with three kinds of chickens and wild boar. This one was deep and meaty. The gamy aspects of both the chicken and boar were offset by the craft soy sauce used.    Yamaguchi's simple looking ramen was pitted against Watanabe's creation; truffle ramen. Fresh truffles were used to make the broth, as well as making an appearance as a topping.    Fight!    The truffles came out on top.    I tried to sample the truffle one as well, but the fact that I waited an hour before opening for Yamaguchi was a pretty clear sign that I wouldn't be slurping both. These bowls were limited to just 50 a day.    You should go to Yamaguchi, even though this limited bowl is long gone. My original post about this amazing shop is here. I wouldn't be surprised if they are awarded a Michelin star next year.  ",

New hotels, both corporate and boutique, provide hundreds more beds a night in this famous part of town on Tokyo's east side.  I'm a west side guy, so I don't make it out too often, but every time seems to be crazier.  I hate sending people to ramen shops that have a huge line of foreigners and English menus, so finding Mitsui was a blessing.    The shop serves Kitakata-style ramen, made famous in Tokyo at Shichisai. In fact, this shop has a direct connection to them, with the hand-massaged noodles being a big point.    Shio or shoyu. Both are light and refreshing.    The noodles are pressed by hand before boiling, and have a chewier texture than ones that weren't given the five-star treatment.  Everyone who visits Japan should try this style, it's often an eye-opening meal. Simple ingredients with deep flavor. I can't think of many shops as close to the tourism center of Tokyo that bring this level of slurp.

Sure, long-standing favorites Hototogisu and Mugitooribu have incorporated a clam broth into their soup, and newer Sora as well, but there are more.  Clams give a wonderful umami aftertaste, and whether you go full on shellfish, or just use it as an accent, this is a trend I am behind.    Kai serves a few bowls, but the one that put the new shop on the map is their clam salt ramen - 貝塩らーめん.    The master takes Japanese little neck clams (アサリ) as a base, and adds mussels (ムール貝) and scallops (ホタテ) as an accent. This triple shellfish broth is enough to send anyone with an allergy straight to the emergency room.    Topped with simple, legit toppings, Kai is one to watch.    I noticed on the side of the ticket machine, they have many, many limited bowls. Clam Chowder Ramen? Yes, please!    This was for one of my ramen tours, and everyone came away a winner.

I finally, about six years later, made it to their main shop.    The menu has a few options, but you should go for the おやじ麺 - oyajimen - on your first time.  Or go spicy. Or special if you want all the toppings.    As with most ramen shops, the upper left button on the ticket machine is the winner.    So good. The miso is blended with lard to give it a creamy, rich aspect. Simple toppings to match the complex soup.    They make their original miso blend onsite, and if you are lucky enough you can catch them doing it.    The sign says \"Feel free to take photos of us making the miso.\" Unfortunately, they weren't doing it when I was there.    I didn't sense a difference from their Machida shop, which might be more convenient.             神奈川県相模原市中央区中央1-3-1 Kanagawa-ken, Sagamihara-shi, Chuo-ku, Chuo 1-3-1 Closest station: Sagamihara  Open 10:30-1:00am  ",

        "post": " 最強ラーメンFes.    Thanks for subscribing to my YouTube channel!  Anyways, the Grand Tsukemen Fest is now the Grand Ramen Fest, I suppose. A bowl of garlic-spiked tonkotsu ramen by any other name would be just as sweet.    This time, the festival was over six weeks. Each week has ten shops. That's 60 bowls to try! Not only that, but each shop has an ura bowl (裏 = under). You need to eat the regular before you can try these secret bowls. So for the true fanatic, that's 120 bowls to sample.    I'm not about to come out here every week and go crazy (Machida is a bit of a trek for me), but these are the ones we tried. There was also fried rice and gyoza this time around. The gyoza I tried was pretty poor. Stick to the ramen.  I'll shy away from any commentary on the bowls, as this event is in the past now.  Keep an eye on the Ramen Adventures Facebook page for info about the next one. In October, it will be in Shinjuku again, and I'll try to go every week. See you there!                          Please see the event page for current information. It looks like they will have an event every March in Machida and every October in Shinjuku, as well as possible pop ups around Japan.  ",

And while Tsuta is in a rather shady neighborhood, across the street from some short-rest love hotels, Imamura is right in the middle of a brothel alley.    Just outside the window is one of the many shops. 3000 yen to enter.    Well, for less than a third of that price, you can get a solid bowl of creamy chicken soup ramen, served with some freshly grilled chicken chashu.  The shop master, Imamura-san, is there shaking noodles, serving soup, and manning the grill.    The bowl here is spiked with niboshi, dried baby sardines that add a smoky kick to the mix, and a lot of umami.     Awesome egg!  It's a decent bowl on Tokyo's north side. Check it out if you are, ummm, in the neighborhood.      東京都豊島区巣鴨1-13-3 Tokyo, Toshima-ku, Sugamo 1-13-3 Closest station: Sugamo  Open 11:00-23:00 Closed Mondays  ",

They boast 12 shops at the time of writing, all of which have a steady following.    As with most aburasoba, topping selection is key. The noodles alone are great, made with 100% Hokkaido flour, but the five base choices are what make the big difference.    English, Chinese, and Korean. No problem!    I went with the recommended 鶏豚, a super thick gravy made form chicken and pork. It was probably soup at one stage, but this sauce is simmered for two days. This is combined with the shop's signature soy sauce tare seasoning for a bit of kick and a bit of cream.    As with ramen in this style, the next step is to mix it up with your choice of condiments.    Vinegar and hot chili oil are the go-to addition that most people add. Raw garlic and mayonnaise are other popular choices, though I am not a fan of either.    Mix, eat, and if you plan on returning, get a stamp on your stamp card. Prizes for regulars range from a free bowl to t-shirts to custom caps. Some of the top tier prizes require a few hundred visits, though there are opportunities for triple points on certain days.

Yosuke falls into the latter category, with a lot of in-your-face flavors and impact.    Of course, that was what I ordered. There are three options. Go for assari if you want something light. Noukou means thick. Chou noukou is super thick, and the one I recommend.    Line up outside by number.    While newer places like Kagari are making headlines for their modern take on tori paitan, sometimes you just need to wander the confusing back alley's of Nakano and get a bowl that really kicks up the flavor.

I was happy to visit with a group of travelers from my Airbnb tour, and introduce them to a tiny spot in a seedy part of town that most foreigners wouldn't dream of visiting.    Go for the 800 yen chashu bowl, it is a thing of beauty.    Rich, niboshi-spike broth with fat noodles. The bowl here is full of fat and carbs, and one of the most photogenic in Tokyo if I say so.    It's a lot of pork, so if you go with a friend, maybe split it and get one of each.

Tokyo loses a bit of the vibe, and residents complain about the smell. So shops cut corners, or go out of business. Shops like Tanaka Shoten are great, but not so convenient.    When a native Japanese friend from Kyushu told me that his favorite spot in Tokyo is just down the road in Shinjuku, I had to go. Seven bowls of ramen please!    I was on one of my group tours, and we were hungry after the 15 minute walk from Shinjuku Station.    Solid. This bowl was on the rough side. I know some people like their tonkotsu ramen silky smooth and white, but I'll take a flavorful bowl with bits of pork fat any day.    The egg is good, but not necessary.    Quite a big shop, so it worked out well for our group tour.      Crushed it!      東京都新宿区新宿1-4-12 Tokyo, Shinjuku, Shinjuku 1-4-12 Closest station: Shinjuku  Open 11:00-23:00  ",

Ramen Riders is a concept where I will visit all 47 prefectures by motorcycle, slurp the best ramen, ride the best roads, and make a rad video about it. The big kick-off was going to be Golden Week, 2017, a week-long holiday when I could spend about 10 days out and about.  First stop, Mie Prefecture.  And I already had a spot picked out to be featured as the best ramen in Mie. That spot is up in Yokkaichi. Hachinoashiha is amazing.  Then, after shooting all the footage I need, I found myself at Seiunshi.        And damn, if this one wasn't one of the best bowls I've had in the entire country.        They are only open four days a week, and only open for a few hours for lunch.        And as such, they were sold out of everything but their limited edition bowl. Guess I'll try that one!        焼鯵正油らぁ麺. Fried mackerel ramen.        Check this place out. What a trip!        So deep and intense. The smoky flavors were enhanced by the frying, reducing the soup into a flavor bomb of ocean umami and dark soy kick.        Of course, at a shop like this, the noodles are made by hand (well, machine). For this one, flat noodles with a higher kansui content than normal to give them a slippery texture.        Thumbs up all around.        Then the master asked me if I was that crazy foreigner who eats all the ramen? Would I sign a plaque for him?  My pleasure.        We got to talking, and as I was one of the last customers of the day, he checked his pots. Actually, he could scrounge together one more bowl of his famous カキ正油らぁ麺, shoyu ramen made with local Mie oysters. It just wouldn't have much in the way of toppings.  Fine by me. Although technically my third bowl of the day (and it was before 2:00pm), this one really hit the spot. I honestly can't say which I liked more. The deep, smoky mackerel or the lighter, umami-rich oyster.  Come early. Eat both.        What an amazing place. Definitely in my Top 10 countryside shops.  If you are wondering, the videos should be out soon. I've been distracted with other creative work, and YouTube took a side to those.        三重県松阪市嬉野権現前町405-14 Mie-ken, Matsusaka-shi, Gongenmaecho, Doesanyoneeverreadthis 405-14 Closest station: Gongenmae  Open 11:00-13:45 Closed: Monday, Tuesday, Friday  ",

Maybe don't go for the 全部入り (all the toppings, plus extra) if you've already had two bowls of ramen that day.    I'd been wanting to come here for quite some time, as I've met the master on a few occasions at events and festivals. The bowl is also featured heavily on all the popular social media sites, and the fact that I am late to the game is inexcusable. They opened late 2016, by the way.    The menu is deep, with a row of shoyu, a row of shio, a row of niboshi, and space for up to four limited bowls. And tsukemen. Don't forget the tsukemen.    I was in a shio mood, and was lucky to be with two other dudes who wanted to try the rest. Actually, this was a meeting for a possible TV gig. Fingers crossed!    The shio ramen did not disappoint. The aforementioned warning is simply because of the amount of toppings. Three slices of slow-cooked chicken chashu, three slices of pork, and an egg. Plus I think they put extra menma as well. No complaint, as the premium hosomenma is by far the some of the best stuff around.    It's a simple broth, made with four kinds of salt and shellfish.    The shoyu ramen is made from somewhere around seven different soy sauces. The main ones are from Shiga, Gunma, and Saitama, if you are keeping track, with bits of others thrown in for balance.    Both soups were excellent. The area, Highashi-Nagasaki (no relation to the Nagasaki in Kyushu) is a mystery to me. Actually, I almost moved here around seven years ago, only to have the local gangsters cause problems last minute (my things were literally in the moving van when they showed up). But that is a story for another time and place.    And though the ramen was amazing, I never heard from the TV producers again. But that's how we roll here in Tokyo. I might not be touring the countryside with camera's behind me, but I'll keep crushing bowls.      東京都豊島区南長崎5-26-15 Tokyo, Toshima-ku, Minami-Nagasaki 5-26-15 Closest station: Higashi-Nagasaki  Open 11:30-15:00, 18:00-21:00 Sundays 11:00-15:00 Closed Mondays  ",
